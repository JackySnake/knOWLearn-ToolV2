  BACKGROUND: High frequencies of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are found in familial breast carcinomas with BRCA mutations. Although LOH of BRCA1 does not coincide with somatic BRCA1 mutations, reduced BRCA1 protein expression and hypermethylation indicate the involvement of BRCA1 in sporadic carcinogenesis. To further investigate the role of BRCA we determined LOH of BRCA1 and correlated this with LOH in other breast cancer-associated regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 105 sporadic breast carcinomas were analysed for LOH in the regions of BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, Caveolin1, "putative BRCA3", PTEN, ATM and E-cadherin and correlated it with clinicopathological features. RESULTS: We found an overall increase of LOH in carcinomas with simultaneous LOH of BRCA1. Significantly higher LOH rates were detected in the regions of TP53 (80%: 34.7%; p<0.005), 8q21 (72.7%: 30.6%; p<0.010) and 10q22-23 (21.1%: 5.9%; p=0.043). Moreover, estrogen receptor-negative carcinomas revealed LOH of BRCA1 more frequently than estrogen receptor-positive carcinomas (39%: 12%; p=0.003). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that LOH of BRCA1 coincides with a defect of the DNA repair pathway. Therefore, LOH of BRCA1 determines a subgroup of sporadic breast carcinomas sharing genotype/phenotype features with familial breast carcinomas.
  BACKGROUND: Here we present the first paired-end sequencing of tumors from genetically engineered mouse models of cancer to determine how faithfully these models recapitulate the landscape of somatic rearrangements found in human tumors. These were models of Trp53-mutated breast cancer, Brca1- and Brca2-associated hereditary breast cancer, and E-cadherin (Cdh1) mutated lobular breast cancer. RESULTS: We show that although Brca1- and Brca2-deficient mouse mammary tumors have a defect in the homologous recombination pathway there is no apparent difference in the type or frequency of somatic rearrangements found in these cancers when compared to other mouse mammary cancers, and tumors from all genetic backgrounds showed evidence of micro-homology mediated repair and non-homologous end-joining processes. Importantly mouse mammary tumors were found to carry fewer structural rearrangements than human mammary cancers and expressed in-frame fusion genes. Like the fusion genes found in human mammary tumors these were not recurrent. One mouse tumor was found to contain an internal deletion of exons of the Lrp1b gene, which lead to a smaller in-frame transcript. We found internal in-frame deletions in the human ortholog of this gene in a significant number (4.2%) of human cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Paired-end sequencing of mouse mammary tumors revealed that they display significant heterogeneity in their profiles of somatic rearrangement, but importantly fewer rearrangements than cognate human mammary tumors, probably because these cancers have been induced by strong driver mutations engineered into the mouse genome. Both human and mouse mammary cancers carry expressed fusion genes and conserved homozygous deletions.
  MYC regulates a myriad of genes controlling cell proliferation, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. MYC also controls the expression of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair genes and therefore may be a potential target for anticancer therapy to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage or prevent genetic instability. In this report, we studied whether MYC binds to DSB repair gene promoters and modulates cell survival in response to DNA-damaging agents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that MYC associates with several DSB repair gene promoters including Rad51, Rad51B, Rad51C, XRCC2, Rad50, BRCA1, BRCA2, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, Ku70, and DNA ligase IV. Endogenous MYC protein expression was associated with increased RAD51 and KU70 protein expression of a panel of cancer cell lines of varying histopathology. Induction of MYC in G(0)-G(1) and S-G(2)-M cells resulted in upregulation of Rad51 gene expression. MYC knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to decreased RAD51 expression but minimal effects on homologous recombination based on a flow cytometry direct repeat green fluorescent protein assay. siRNA to MYC resulted in tumor cell kill in DU145 and H1299 cell lines in a manner independent of apoptosis. However, MYC-dependent changes in DSB repair protein expression were not sufficient to sensitize cells to mitomycin C or ionizing radiation, two agents selectively toxic to DSB repair-deficient cells. Our results suggest that anti-MYC agents may target cells to prevent genetic instability but would not lead to differential radiosensitization or chemosensitization.

  Background: Tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as BRCA1-associated breast cancers, are not able to reliably repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and are therefore highly sensitive to both DSB-inducing chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. We have studied markers that may indicate the presence of HRD in HER2-negative breast cancers and related them to neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. Patients and methods: Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), BRCA1 promoter methylation, BRCA1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and EMSY amplification were assessed in 163 HER2-negative pretreatment biopsies from patients scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Features of BRCA1 dysfunction were frequent in triple-negative (TN) tumors: a BRCA1-like aCGH pattern, promoter methylation and reduced mRNA expression were observed in, respectively, 57%, 25% and 36% of the TN tumors. In ER+ tumors, a BRCA2-like aCGH pattern and the amplification of the BRCA2 inhibiting gene EMSY were frequently observed (43% and 13%, respectively) and this BRCA2-like profile was associated with a better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: Abnormalities associated with BRCA1 inactivation are present in about half of the TN breast cancers but were not predictive of chemotherapy response. In ER+/HER2- tumors, a BRCA2-like aCGH pattern was predictive of chemotherapy response. These findings should be confirmed in independent series.
  Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease with a frequency of approximately one in 1000. Due to the rarity of MBC, it is understudied and its etiology is poorly understood. Our objectives are to determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in MBC cases and to investigate the correlations between mutation status and cancer phenotypes. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer. The difference in BRCA2-mutation frequencies between cases with and without family history of breast cancer was not statistically significant (P = 0.145), suggesting that family history is not a strong predictor of carrying a mutation in males. We observed a highly significant association of carrying a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with high tumor grade (P < 0.001) and a weak association with positive lymph nodes (P < 0.02). Of the 97 BRCA2-negative MBC cases, we identified one PALB2 mutation with confirmed pathogenicity and one mutation predicted to be pathogenic, a prevalence of pathogenic PALB2-mutation of 1-2%. Based on our results and previous studies, genetic testing for BRCA2 should be recommended for any diagnosed MBC case, regardless of family history of breast cancer.
  BACKGROUND: The frequency and characteristics of disease in individuals who concomitantly harbor pathogenic mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are not established. Materials and methods: Data were collected from the database of Clalit Health Services National Familial Cancer Consultation Service. Probands referred to this clinical service and their family members are routinely tested for the three Jewish founder mutations (BRCA1:185delAG, 5382insC, BRCA2:6174delT). In addition, carriers identified in a population-based cohort of all cases diagnosed with breast cancer in Israel in 1987-1988 allowed the estimation of the population frequency of this phenomenon. RESULTS: In the clinic-based series of 1191 carriers of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 belonging to 567 families, 22 males and females (1.85%) from 17 different families (3.0%) were found to harbor two different mutations. These included 18 individuals (1.51%) who concomitantly carried the 185delAG BRCA1 and the 6174delT BRCA2 mutations and four individuals (0.34%) who carried the 5382insC BRCA1 and the 6174delT mutations. All individuals were heterozygote carriers and none had a double mutation of both founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene itself. Seven of the 16 double carrier women (46.7%) had a personal history of breast carcinoma, diagnosed at a mean age of 44.6, compared with 372/926 (40.2%) carriers of a single mutation diagnosed with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-4.0]. One case (6.7%) had a personal history of ovarian carcinoma diagnosed at the age of 53 compared with 55/926 (5.9%) of the women with single mutation (OR = 1.1, CI = 0.2-7.6). The frequency of double mutations in the population-based national breast cancer cohort was 2.2% of all carriers, and 0.3% of all breast cancer cases in the Ashkenazi population in the cohort. The mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was younger in the carriers of two mutations. CONCLUSION: Double carriers of mutations in the BRCA genes are rare and seem to be carrying a similar probability of developing breast and ovarian cancers as carriers of single mutations.

  Background Germline mutations in CDH1 are associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer; lobular breast cancer also occurs excessively in families with such condition. Method To determine if CDH1 is a susceptibility gene for lobular breast cancer in women without a family history of diffuse gastric cancer, germline DNA was analysed for the presence of CDH1 mutations in 318 women with lobular breast cancer who were diagnosed before the age of 45&emsp14;years or had a family history of breast cancer and were not known, or known not, to be carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Cases were ascertained through breast cancer registries and high-risk cancer genetic clinics (Breast Cancer Family Registry, the kConFab and a consortium of breast cancer genetics clinics in the United States and Spain). Additionally, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification was performed for 134 cases to detect large deletions. Results No truncating mutations and no large deletions were detected. Six non-synonymous variants were found in seven families. Four (4/318 or 1.3%) are considered to be potentially pathogenic through in vitro and in silico analysis. Conclusion Potentially pathogenic germline CDH1 mutations in women with early-onset or familial lobular breast cancer are at most infrequent.
  ABSTRACT In this study, MLPA assay was performed for detection of large rearrangements of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 16 familial, 29 early onset, 3 male breast cancer, and 2 bilateral breast/ovarian cancer high risk Turkish index cases. MLPA assay for all exons of both genes and for 1100delC variant of CHEK2 gene were performed. Analyses, revealed no large genomic rearrangements in both genes, and, no 1100del variant in CHEK2 gene. Our data which represents the first results for Turkish patients, suggest that, the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes&#x2019; large rearrangements is very low.
  BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are identified in less than 50% of hereditary breast cancer cases. Besides BRCA1/2 further high-risk breast cancer genes are known; however they account only for a small fraction of inherited breast cancer cases. Most of them are involved in rare cancer predisposition syndromes. Moderate and low-risk breast cancer genes confer modest cancer risk up to 10% and may be more relevant due to polygenic inheritance. The majority of hereditary breast cancer cases are still caused by unknown genes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Genetic testing of other known genes is not yet routinely performed in families tested negative for BRCA1/2-mutations, but can be recommended in special patients. In case of a calculated high-risk situation, participation in an early-detection screening program should be recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is heterogeneous and conferred by a large number of identified and yet undetected genes.
  We report an adult male with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and a germline BRCA2 mutation who developed T-cell monoclonal lymphoid proliferation involving the skin and a polyclonal proliferation of a retroperitoneal lymph node without any identifiable infectious and inflammatory causes. This is the first report of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in the setting of co-occurrence of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and a BRCA2 mutation. Further cases with a similar presentation should be reported and studies should be directed to identify the possible mechanisms involved.
  The responsibility for informing at-risk relatives of the availability of genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutations currently falls on the probands. This study explored the support needs of individuals from families with identified BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations when communicating about genetic risk and genetic testing with at-risk family members. Thirty-nine semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with individuals from families with identified BRCA mutations. Interview responses were cross-tabulated by sample characteristics using the qualitative research analysis software NVivo8. The development of educational materials, which individuals could use when communicating the risks of carrying a BRCA gene mutation with their relatives, was identified as a specific need. Many participants expressed a preference for a staged approach, where relatives are notified of their increased risk and the availability of genetic testing risk either face-to-face or via a letter, with additional educational sources, including brief written information or access to a website, made available for those wishing to access more in-depth information. This research identified a need for the development of educational/informational resources to support individuals with identified breast/ovarian cancer mutations to communicate with their at-risk relatives about genetic risk and genetic testing availability.
  Heterozygous germ line mutations in the Breast CAncer1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes can lead to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, in addition to a significantly increased susceptibility of pancreatic, prostate and male breast cancer. The BRCA2 belongs to the tumor suppressor gene family and the protein encoded by this gene is involved in the repair of chromosomal damage, with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks. After complete sequencing of coding regions and splice junctions of both genes, in a family with breast cancer history, a non previously reported heterozygous mutation in BRCA2 was detected and studied in an Italian healthy female. The direct sequencing disclosed, on exon 15, an insertion (7525_7526insT). The frame shift mutation of BRCA2 causes a disruption of the translational reading frame, resulting in a stop codon 29 amino acids downstream, in the 2538 position of the BRCA2 protein. The mutated allele codifies a truncated protein, lacking the two putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that reside within the extreme C-terminal domain of BRCA2. Since this mutant protein not performs a translocation into the nucleus, it is fully non-functional.
  BACKGROUND: The BRCA2 gene is responsible for a high number of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and studies of the BRCA2 biological functions are limited by the lack of models that resemble the patient's tumour features. The aim of this study was to establish and characterise a new human breast carcinoma xenograft obtained from a woman carrying a germline BRCA2 mutation. METHODS: A transplantable xenograft was obtained by grafting a breast cancer sample into nude mice. The biological and genetic profiles of the xenograft were compared with that of the patient's tumour using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRCA2 sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), and qRT-PCR. Tumour response to standard chemotherapies was evaluated. RESULTS: Histological profile identified the tumour as a basal-like triple-negative breast cancer. Targeted BRCA2 DNA sequencing of the xenograft showed the presence of the mutation previously identified in the carrier. Comparative genomic hybridisation array profiles of the primary tumour and the xenograft revealed a high number of similar genetic alterations. The therapeutic assessment of the xenograft showed sensitivity to anthracyclin-based chemotherapy and resistance to docetaxel. The xenograft was also highly sensitive to radiotherapy and cisplatin-based treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a new human breast cancer xenograft obtained from a BRCA2-mutated patient. This xenograft provides a new model for the pre-clinical drug development and for the exploration of the drug response biological basis.
  BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding cancer risks for relatives of women with very early-onset breast cancer. METHODS: We studied 2208 parents and siblings of 504 unselected population-based Caucasian women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 years (103 from USA, 124 from Canada and 277 from Australia), 41 known to carry a mutation (24 in BRCA1, 16 in BRCA2 and one in both genes). Cancer-specific standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by comparing the number of affected relatives (50% verified overall) with that expected based on incidences specific for country, sex, age and year of birth. RESULTS: For relatives of carriers, the female breast cancer SIRs were 13.13 (95% CI 6.57-26.26) and 12.52 (5.21-30.07) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. The ovarian cancer SIR was 12.38 (3.1-49.51) for BRCA1 and the prostate cancer SIR was 18.55 (4.64-74.17) for BRCA2. For relatives of non-carriers, the SIRs for female breast, prostate, lung, brain and urinary cancers were 4.03 (2.91-5.93), 5.25 (2.50-11.01), 7.73 (4.74-12.62), 5.19 (2.33-11.54) and 4.35 (1.81-10.46), respectively. For non-carriers, the SIRs remained elevated and were statistically significant for breast and prostate cancer when based on verified cancers. CONCLUSION: First-degree relatives of women with very early-onset breast cancer are at increased risk of cancers not explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
  BACKGROUND: Increasingly, women with a strong family history of breast cancer are seeking genetic testing as a starting point to making significant decisions regarding management of their cancer risks. Individuals who are found to be carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a substantially elevated risk for breast cancer and are frequently faced with the decision of whether to undergo risk-reducing mastectomy. OBJECTIVE: In order to provide BRCA1/2 carriers with ongoing decision support for breast cancer risk management, a computer-based interactive decision aid was developed and tested against usual care in a randomized controlled trial. DESIGN: . Following genetic counseling, 214 female (aged 21-75 years) BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were randomized to usual care (UC; n = 114) or usual care plus decision aid (DA; n = 100) arms. UC participants received no further intervention; DA participants were sent the CD-ROM-based decision aid to view at home. Main Outcome MEASURES: The authors measured general distress, cancer-specific distress, and genetic testing-specific distress at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up time points postrandomization. RESULTS: Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant longitudinal impact of the DA on cancer-specific distress (B = 5.67, z = 2.81, P = 0.005), which varied over time (DA group by time; B = -2.19, z = -2.47, P = 0.01), and on genetic testing-specific distress (B = 5.55, z = 2.46, P = 0.01), which also varied over time (DA group by time; B = -2.46, z = -2.51, P = 0.01). Individuals randomized to UC reported significantly decreased distress in the month following randomization, whereas individuals randomized to the DA maintained their postdisclosure distress over the short term. By 12 months, the overall decrease in distress between the 2 groups was similar. CONCLUSION: This report provides new insight into the long-term longitudinal effects of DAs.
  The pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers has been difficult to elucidate despite intense effort. Recently, though, the care of women felt to be at high risk due to a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer or a known germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has provided potential insight into the development of these malignancies. Risk-reducing surgical removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, called risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (RRBSO), is commonly performed as a laparoscopic procedure to minimize recovery time. We describe here an optimized surgical sampling workflow for analyzing the proteomes of peritoneal, fallopian tube, and ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) specimens collected at the time of laparoscopic RRBSO, a technique which has not been described previously. This methodology presents a unique opportunity for closer examination of the proteomic alterations in the tissues at risk for malignant transformation in women with an inherited susceptibility to ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer development.
  A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) found significant association between the PALB2 SNP rs420259 and bipolar disorder (BD). The intracellular functions of the expressed proteins from the breast cancer risk genes PALB2 and BRCA2 are closely related. Therefore, we investigated the relation between genetic variants in PALB2 and BRCA2 and BD. Due to increasing evidence of genetic overlap between BD and schizophrenia (SCZ), we also investigated association with SCZ. In a Scandinavian case-control sample (n = 686/2,538) we found the BRCA2 SNP rs9567552 to be significantly associated with BD (Nominal P = 0.00043). Additionally, we replicated the association between PALB2 SNP rs420259 and BD (Nominal P = 0.025). We then combined our sample with another Nordic case-control sample (n = 435/11,491) from Iceland, and added results from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) (n = 1,868/2,938) and the STEP-UCL/ED-DUB-STEP2 study (n = 2,558/3,274) in a meta-analysis which revealed a P-value of 1.2 × 10(-5) for association between PALB2 SNP rs420259 and BD (n = 5,547/20,241). Neither the PALB2 SNP rs420259 nor the BRCA2 SNP rs9567552 were nominally significantly associated with the SCZ phenotype in our Scandinavian sample (n = 781/2,839). Our findings support PALB2 and BRCA2 as risk genes specifically for BD, and suggest that altered DNA repair related to neurogenesis may be involved in BD pathophysiology. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
  Homologous recombination mediated by RAD51 recombinase helps eliminate chromosomal lesions, such as DNA double-strand breaks induced by radiation or arising from injured DNA replication forks. The tumor suppressors BRCA2 and PALB2 act together to deliver RAD51 to chromosomal lesions to initiate repair. Here we document a new function of PALB2: to enhance RAD51's ability to form the D loop. We show that PALB2 binds DNA and physically interacts with RAD51. Notably, although PALB2 alone stimulates D-loop formation, it has a cooperative effect with RAD51AP1, an enhancer of RAD51. This stimulation stems from the ability of PALB2 to function with RAD51 and RAD51AP1 to assemble the synaptic complex. Our results demonstrate the multifaceted role of PALB2 in chromosome damage repair. Because PALB2 mutations can cause cancer or Fanconi anemia, our findings shed light on the mechanism of tumor suppression in humans.
  Inherited mutations in human PALB2 are associated with a predisposition to breast and pancreatic cancers. PALB2's tumor-suppressing effect is thought to be based on its ability to facilitate BRCA2's function in homologous recombination. However, the biochemical properties of PALB2 are unknown. Here we show that human PALB2 binds DNA, preferentially D-loop structures, and directly interacts with the RAD51 recombinase to stimulate strand invasion, a vital step of homologous recombination. This stimulation occurs through reinforcing biochemical mechanisms, as PALB2 alleviates inhibition by RPA and stabilizes the RAD51 filament. Moreover, PALB2 can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. Finally, we show that PALB2-deficient cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Our studies provide the first biochemical insights into PALB2's function with piBRCA2 as a mediator of homologous recombination in DNA double-strand break repair.
  The tubal p53 signature is a putative precursor to pelvic serous carcinoma, but its frequencies in women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA+) and controls has been controversial. An initial section and two levels (100-200 μm) from every block in BRCA+ (24) and control tubes (40) were stained for p53. The frequency of p53 signatures was computed between the populations and across the three levels from each block, and analyzed by Fisher exact test. A total of 17 (71%) BRCA+ and 20 (50%) control tubes were p53 signature positive (P=0.12); 21 and 16% of all tissue blocks sectioned harbored signatures (P=0.29), and 76 and 67% were found in the fimbria. In 49 and 32% of p53 signature positive cases in the two groups, the p53 signatures were not discovered until the second or third round of sectioning. In all, 38 and 40% of BRCA+ and control subjects harbored p53 signatures in more than one focus in a single block. In one case (BRCA+), a highly atypical proliferation was identified in one serial section. The p53 signatures are more common than previously reported and the frequency of detection increases as a function of sectioning through the tissue block, both in absolute frequency and in numbers of p53 signatures detected in a given block. There is a trend for a higher absolute frequency of p53 signatures (71 vs 50%; P=0.12) in BRCA+ subjects, but this is not reflected in a greater average number of p53 signatures or positive blocks per case. This study underscores the importance of systematic immunohistochemical examination of fallopian tubes when conducting epidemiological studies that compare the frequency of p53 signatures in different populations. Attention to this detail is critical when exploring risk factors germane to early serous carcinogenesis.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 24 September 2010; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2010.171.
  The distribution of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in breast/ovarian cancer (BC/OC) families varies among different populations. In the Chilean population, there are only two reports of mutation analysis of BRCA1/2, and these included a low number of BC and/or OC patients. Moreover, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 genomic rearrangements in Chilean and in other South American populations is unknown. In this article, we present the mutation-detection data corresponding to a set of 326 high-risk families analyzed by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and heteroduplex analysis. To determine the contribution of BRCA1/2 LGRs in Chilean BC patients, we analyzed 56 high-risk subjects with no pathogenic BRCA1/2 point mutations. Germline BRCA1/2 point mutations were found in 23 (7.1%) of the 326 Chilean families. Families which had at least three BC and/or OC cases showed the highest frequency of mutations (15.9%). We identified 14 point pathogenic mutations. Three recurrent mutations in BRCA1 (c.187_188delAG, c.2605_2606delTT, and c.3450_3453delCAAG) and three in BRCA2 (c.4969_4970insTG, c.5374_5377delTATG, and c.6503_6504delTT) contributed to 63.6 and 66.7% of all the deleterious mutations of each gene, which may reflect the presence of region-specific founder effects. Taken together BRCA1/2 recurrent point mutations account for 65.2% (15/23) of the BRCA1/2 (+) families. No large deletions or duplications involving BRCA1/2 were identified in a subgroup of 56 index cases negative for BRCA1/2 point mutations. Our study, which is the largest conducted to date in a South American population, provides a comprehensive analysis on the type and distribution of BRCA1/2 mutations and allelic variants.
  Partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) was originally identified as a BRCA2-interacting protein that is crucial for key BRCA2 genome caretaker functions. It subsequently became clear that PALB2 was another Fanconi anemia (FA) gene (FANCN), and that monoallelic PALB2 mutations are associated with increased risk of breast and pancreatic cancer. Mutations in PALB2 have been identified in breast cancer families worldwide, and recent studies have shown that PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1. Here, we summarize the molecular functions and clinical phenotypes of this key DNA repair pathway component and discuss how its discovery has advanced our knowledge of both FA and adult cancer predisposition.
  High-resolution melting (HRM) of DNA is a versatile method for mutation scanning that monitors the fluorescence of double-strand DNA with saturating dye. Performing HRM on a real-time thermocycler enables semiquantitative analysis (quantitative polymerase chain reaction, qPCR) to be associated to HRM analysis for detection of both large gene rearrangements and point mutations (qPCR-HRM). We evaluated this method of mutation screening for the two major breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Screening of these two genes is time-consuming and must include exploration of large rearrangements that represent 5% to 15% of the alterations observed in these genes. To assess the reliability of the HRM technology, 201 known nucleotide variations scattered over all amplicons were tested. The sensitivity of qPCR was evaluated by analyzing seven large rearrangements. All previously identified variants tested were detected by qPCR-HRM. A retrospective study was done with 45 patients: qPCR-HRM allowed all the variants previously tested by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to be identified. qPCR analysis showed three cases of allele dropout (due to a 104-bp deletion, SNP primer mismatch, and an Alu insertion). A prospective study was done with 165 patients allowing 22 deleterious mutations, 16 unclassified variants, and 2 rearrangements to be detected. qPCR-HRM is a simple, sensitive, and fast method that does not require modified PCR primers. Thus, this method allows in one step the detection of point mutation, gene rearrangements, and prevention of missing a mutation due to primer mismatch.
  Rare germline monoallelic mutations in PALB2 confer a relative risk of breast cancer of 2 to 4-times. To better define the role of PALB2 in breast cancer susceptibility in Italian breast or breast-ovarian cancer families we screened 95 index cases negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations. The mutational analysis of the PALB2 gene in a index case of an high risk breast cancer family, has identified a frameshift mutation (c.1517delG) in the exon 4 that leads to the formation of a stop codon, 12 residues downstream of the mutation (Leu451X). The mutation was identified in a woman 52 year old with an infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma and in two of the three sisters without breast cancer. Our results confirmed that PALB2 could be a susceptibility gene for familial breast cancer also in Italian population.
  OBJECTIVES: The genes associated with familial Endometrial Cancer (EC) are largely unknown. While EC is an integral part of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer, there is an ongoing debate if EC is indeed overrepresented in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families. METHODS: Unselected Jewish women with EC who were diagnosed from January1982 to January 2008 were genotyped for the predominant mutations in Jewish individuals in BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382InsC, Tyr978X) BRCA2 (6174delT), MSH2 (A636P, 324delCA) and MSH6 (c.3984_3987dup). RESULTS: Overall, 289 Jewish women with EC were included, the majority (217-75%) were Ashkenazim. Mean age at diagnosis was 62.6±12years, the most common histopathology was type I (endometrioid carcinoma) (80.4% of participants) with 29 having type II (Uterine papillary serous and clear cell cancer) Most patients (85.4%) had stage 1 disease by the FIGO staging. Five women (1.7%-2.3% of the Ashkenazim) carried either the BRCA1*185delAG (n=4) or BRCA2*6174delT (n=1) mutations, a rate similar with that of the general Ashkenazi population. Notably, none of 34 women with type II EC carried any BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Four (1.8%) and three (1.4%) of the 217 Ashkenazim patients harbored the c.3984_3987dup, A636P, MSH6 and MSH2 mutations, respectively, and 1/72 (1.4%) of the non-Ashkenazi patients harbored the 324delCA MSH2 mutation. Three of 42 (7.1%) women with EC diagnosed <50years carried either BRCA1 MSH6 or MSH2 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support screening for BRCA1/2 mutations in consecutive EC patients.
  Hereditary factors are responsible for 5-10% of all breast cancers and 10% of all ovarian cancer cases and are predominantly caused by mutations in the high risk genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA: breast cancer). Additional moderate and low penetrance gene variants are currently being analyzed via whole genome association studies. Interdisciplinary counseling, quality managed genetic testing and intensified prevention efforts in specialized medical centres are essential for members of high risk families considering the high prevalence of malignant tumors and the early age of onset. Furthermore, the identification of BRCA-deficient carcinomas is of particular clinical interest, especially regarding new specific therapeutic options, e.g. treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. There are presently no valid surrogate markers verifying the association of BRCA1/BRC2 in tumors. However, breast cancers harboring pathogenic BRCA1 mutations in particular display specific histopathological features.
  AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the growth rate of inherited breast cancer, to analyze its T2 signal intensity besides kinetic and morphologic aspects, and to verify whether there is any correlation between magnetic resonance imaging phenotype and BRCA status. METHODS: Between June 2000 and September 2009, we enrolled 227 women at high genetic risk for breast cancer in a surveillance program, within a multicenter project of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Rome). RESULTS: Thirty-four cancers were detected among 31 subjects. One patient refused magnetic resonance imaging because of claustrophobia. Compared with sporadic disease, hereditary cancer showed some differences, in terms of biologic attitude and semeiotic patterns. These differences were mainly registered for magnetic resonance imaging, where the most frequent radiological variant was represented by the very high T2 signal intensity (73%). Moreover, the size of 8 of the neoplasms showed a significant increase in less than one year, 5 of them in less than 6 months. Six lesions were in BRCA1 patients and the remaining in BRCA2. Furthermore, cancers with a high growth rate also demonstrated a significant increment in T2 signal intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the high growth rate within BRCA-related breast cancers, especially for BRCA1 mutation carriers. In our experience, we found a specific imaging phenotype, represented by the high T2 signal intensity of hereditary breast cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report that points out this new semeiotic parameter, which is usually typical of benign lesions. Considering the correlation between high growth rate and high T2 signal intensity, the former seems to be related to the absence of induction of a desmoplastic reaction that could somehow restrict cancer growth.
  BACKGROUND: BRCA1 gene inactivation causes chromosomal instability, leading to rapid accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements and mutations. The loss of BRCA1 function due to either germline/somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing is observed in most high-grade serous carcinomas of the ovary. METHODS: DNA ploidy and gene expression profile were used in order to compare gross genomic alteration and gene expression pattern between cases with BRCA1 loss through mutation, BRCA1 epigenetic loss, and no BRCA1 loss in cases of high-grade serous carcinoma with known BRCA1 and BRCA 2 status. RESULTS: Using image cytometry and oligonucleotide microarrays, we analyzed DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction and gene expression profile of 28 consecutive cases of ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinomas, which included 8 tumor samples with BRCA1 somatic or germline mutation, 9 samples with promoter hypermethylation of BRCA1, and 11 samples with no BRCA1 loss. None had BRCA2 mutations. The prevalence of aneuploidy and tetraploidy was not statistically different in the three groups with different BRCA1 status. The gene expression profiles were also very similar between the groups, with only two genes showing significant differential expression when comparison was made between the group with BRCA1 mutation and the group with no demonstrable BRCA1 loss. There were no genes showing significant differences in expression when the group with BRCA1 loss through epigenetic silencing was compared to either of the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of 28 high-grade serous carcinomas, gross genomic alteration characterized by aneuploidy did not correlate with BRCA1 status. In addition, the gene expression profiles of the tumors showed negligible differences between the three defined groups based on BRCA1 status. This suggests that all ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas arise through oncogenic mechanisms that result in chromosomal instability, irrespective of BRCA status; the molecular abnormalities underlying this in the BRCA intact tumors remains unknown.
  Study Type - Diagnostic (validating cohort) Level of Evidence 1b OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of targeted prostate cancer screening in men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, an international study, IMPACT (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls), was established. This is the first multicentre screening study targeted at men with a known genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. A preliminary analysis of the data is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men aged 40-69 years from families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were offered annual prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, and those with PSA >3 ng/mL, were offered a prostate biopsy. Controls were men age-matched (± 5 years) who were negative for the familial mutation. RESULTS: In total, 300 men were recruited (205 mutation carriers; 89 BRCA1, 116 BRCA2 and 95 controls) over 33 months. At the baseline screen (year 1), 7.0% (21/300) underwent a prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in ten individuals, a prevalence of 3.3%. The positive predictive value of PSA screening in this cohort was 47·6% (10/21). One prostate cancer was diagnosed at year 2. Of the 11 prostate cancers diagnosed, nine were in mutation carriers, two in controls, and eight were clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the positive predictive value of PSA screening in BRCA mutation carriers is high and that screening detects clinically significant prostate cancer. These results support the rationale for continued screening in such men.
  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced during clinical radiotherapy are potent inducers of cell death. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 is a 113-kD nuclear protein that binds to both single- and double-strand DNA breaks and is actively involved in DNA single-strand break repair and base excision repair. Recently, potent and specific chemical inhibitors of PARP activity have been developed that are effective tumor cell radiosensitizers in vitro and in vivo. Because of synthetic lethality, PARP inhibitors may be highly effective as a single agent in patients whose tumors have germline or somatic defects in DNA damage and repair genes (eg, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and NBS1) or defects in genes involved in phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) signaling. Defects in specific DNA repair pathways also appear to enhance the radiosensitizing effects of PARP inhibition. In addition to inherent genetics, tumor cells may also be preferentially sensitized to radiotherapy by diverse mechanisms, including proliferation-dependent radiosensitization, targeting of the endothelium and tumor vasculature, and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors within repair-deficient hypoxic cells. Because biologically active doses of PARP inhibitors caused minimal toxicity in phase I to II clinical trials, careful scheduling of these agents in combination with radiotherapy may maintain the therapeutic ratio and increase tumor radiocurability.
  Topoisomerase II (Top2) is a nuclear enzyme involved in several metabolic processes of DNA. Chemotherapy agents that poison Top2 are known to induce persistent protein-mediated DNA double strand breaks (DSB). In this report, by using knock down experiments, we demonstrated that Top2alpha was largely responsible for the induction of gammaH2AX and cytotoxicity by the Top2 poisons idarubicin and etoposide in normal human cells. As DSB resulting from Top2 poisons-mediated damage may be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), we aimed to analyze both DNA repair pathways. We found that DNA-PKcs was rapidly activated in human cells, as evidenced by autophosphorylation at serine 2056, following Top2-mediated DNA damage. The chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs by wortmannin and vanillin resulted in an increased accumulation of DNA DSB, as evaluated by the comet assay. This was supported by a hypersensitive phenotype to Top2 poisons of Ku80- and DNA-PKcs- defective Chinese hamster cell lines. We also showed that Rad51 protein levels, Rad51 foci formation and sister chromatid exchanges were increased in human cells following Top2-mediated DNA damage. In support, BRCA2- and Rad51C- defective Chinese hamster cells displayed hypersensitivity to Top2 poisons. The analysis by immunofluorescence of the DNA DSB repair response in synchronized human cell cultures revealed activation of DNA-PKcs throughout the cell cycle and Rad51 foci formation in S and late S/G2 cells. Additionally, we found an increase of DNA-PKcs-mediated residual repair events, but not Rad51 residual foci, into micronucleated and apoptotic cells. Therefore, we conclude that in human cells both NHEJ and HR are required, with cell cycle stage specificity, for the repair of Top2-mediated reversible DNA damage. Moreover, NHEJ-mediated residual repair events are more frequently associated to irreversibly damaged cells.
  DSS1 is a small, highly acidic protein widely conserved among eukaryotes as a component of the 19S proteasome and implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein functions in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks, and does so in part through the actions of a carboxy-proximal region that binds DNA and several other proteins, including DSS1. In the unicellular eukaryote Ustilago maydis, Dss1 interacts with Brh2, a BRCA2-like protein, and regulates its function in mediating HRR. We used RNA interference to deplete DSS1 in human cells, and assayed the effects on double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Partial depletion of DSS1 protein in human cells reduced the efficiency of HRR to small fractions of normal levels. Residual HRR activity correlated roughly with the residual level of DSS1 expression. The results imply that mammalian DSS1 makes a critical contribution to the function of BRCA2 in mediating HRR, and hence to genomic stability. Activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can influence HRR. However, treatment with proteasome inhibitors only partially reproduced the effects of DSS1 depletion on HRR, suggesting that the function of DSS1 in HRR involves more than proteolysis per se.
  A small, but important, percentage of breast cancer cases is caused by the inheritance of a single copy of a mutated gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the genes most commonly associated with inherited breast cancer; however, mutations in TP53 and PTEN cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Cowden syndrome, respectively, both of which are associated with high lifetime risks of breast cancer. Advances in the field of breast cancer genetics have led to an improved understanding of detection and prevention strategies. More recently, strategies to target the underlying genetic defects in BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast and ovarian cancers are emerging and may have implications for certain types of sporadic breast cancer.
  The heterogeneity of multiple case breast cancer families that do not carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (non-BRCA1/2 families) poses a challenge to the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to determine whether intrafamilial concordance in breast cancer pathology could identify subgroups of non-BRCA1/2 families with consistent genotypic features. Invasive breast cancers were reviewed from 84 individuals belonging to 30 multiple-case families; BRCA1 (n = 9), BRCA2 (n = 10), and non-BRCA1/2 (n = 11). Hierarchical cluster analysis based on histopathology and age at first diagnosis was then used to specify three subgroups designated Clusters 1-3. The genomic features of non-BRCA1/2 families were examined by genome wide linkage and FGFR2 SNP genotyping, according to whether they showed cluster-concordant or cluster-mixed familial pathology. The majority of pathogenic BRCA1 mutation carriers (80%) fell into a single cluster. In contrast pathogenic BRCA2 mutation carriers were distributed across all three clusters and within families, cluster groups were also generally mixed. Most non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers belonged to Cluster 3 (71%). Genome wide linkage data from five non-BRCA1/2 Cluster 3-concordant families were compared with four mixed cluster non-BRCA1/2 families. This revealed a number of distinct linkage peaks, including some regions previously associated with breast cancer susceptibility. The distribution of low risk alleles in FGFR2 was not different between these two subgroups (P = 0.237). The pattern of breast cancer pathology concordance amongst family members may assist the investigation of breast cancer susceptibility in multiple case families. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
  The recent explosion of hereditary breast cancer genetic research has strengthened our understanding of genetic influences on health and disease. These scientific advances have significant implications for clinical oncology nurses and advanced practice nurses. In this paper, the Human Response to Illness Model (Mitchell, Gallucci, & Fought, 1991) is utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of breast cancer related to the human response of genetic mutations. Accordingly, the research literature related to the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioural, and experiential perspectives of BRCA-related breast cancer will be highlighted. This research-based evidence will provide oncology nurses with the skills to establish a holistic plan of care for women with an actual or potential genetic risk for breast cancer.
  Heredity represents the strongest risk factor for ovarian cancer with disease predisposing mutations identified in 15% of the tumors. With the aim to identify genetic classifiers for hereditary ovarian cancer, we profiled hereditary ovarian cancers linked to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization was applied to 12 HBOC associated tumors with BRCA1 mutations and 8 HNPCC associated tumors with mismatch repair gene mutations with 24 sporadic ovarian cancers as a control group. Unsupervised cluster analysis identified two distinct subgroups related to genetic complexity. Sporadic and HBOC associated tumors had complex genetic profiles with an average 41% of the genome altered, whereas the mismatch repair defective tumors had stable genetic profiles, with an average 18% of the genome altered. Losses of 4q34, 13q12-q32 and 19p13 were overrepresented in the HBOC subset. Discriminating genes within these regions include BRCA2, FOXO1A and RB1. Gains on chromosomes 17 and 19 characterized the HNPCC tumors, but target genes herein are unknown. The results indicate that HBOC and HNPCC associated ovarian cancer develop along distinct genetic pathways and genetic profiles can thus be applied to distinguish between different types of hereditary ovarian cancer.
  CONTEXT: Mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are widely used by carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations to reduce their risks of breast and ovarian cancer. OBJECTIVE: To estimate risk and mortality reduction stratified by mutation and prior cancer status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, multicenter cohort study of 2482 women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations ascertained between 1974 and 2008. The study was conducted at 22 clinical and research genetics centers in Europe and North America to assess the relationship of risk-reducing mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy with cancer outcomes. The women were followed up until the end of 2009. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Breast and ovarian cancer risk, cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality. RESULTS: No breast cancers were diagnosed in the 247 women with risk-reducing mastectomy compared with 98 women of 1372 diagnosed with breast cancer who did not have risk-reducing mastectomy. Compared with women who did not undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, women who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy had a lower risk of ovarian cancer, including those with prior breast cancer (6% vs 1%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.59) and those without prior breast cancer (6% vs 2%; HR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12-0.69]), and a lower risk of first diagnosis of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers (20% vs 14%; HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.41-0.96]) and BRCA2 mutation carriers (23% vs 7%; HR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.16-0.82]). Compared with women who did not undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, undergoing salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (10% vs 3%; HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.26-0.61]), breast cancer-specific mortality (6% vs 2%; HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26-0.76]), and ovarian cancer-specific mortality (3% vs 0.4%; HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06-0.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the use of risk-reducing mastectomy was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer, first diagnosis of breast cancer, all-cause mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and ovarian cancer-specific mortality.
  Published data on the association between mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1) gene rs889312 polymorphism and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between them. A total of seven eligible articles including 26,015 cases and 33,962 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis. We observed that the MAP3K1 rs889312 polymorphism was significantly correlated with breast cancer risk from the fixed effects model when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (the allele contrast model: OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.12; the homozygote codominant: OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.29; the heterozygote codominant: OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.11; the dominant model: OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.13; the recessive model: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). No significant association was found in the BRCA1 mutation carriers in all genetic models. When stratified by BRCA2 mutation carriers status, statistically significantly elevated risk was found in this meta-analysis (C vs. A: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.23; CC vs. AA: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.71; the recessive model: OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.65). There was no evidence for significant association between MAP3K1 rs889312 polymorphism and breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 positive cohort for all comparison models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the MAP3K1 rs889312 C allele is a low-penetrant risk factor for developing breast cancer, and there is limited evidence to indicate that MAP3K1 rs889312 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have elevated risks of breast and ovarian cancers. The risks for cancers at other sites remain unclear. Melanoma has been associated with BRCA2 mutations in some studies, however, few surveys have included non-melanoma skin cancer. We followed 2729 women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation for an average of 5.0 years. These women were asked to report new cases of cancer diagnosed in themselves or in their family. The risks of skin cancer were compared for probands with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Of 1779 women with a BRCA1 mutation, 29 developed skin cancer in the follow-up period (1.6%). Of the 950 women with a BRCA2 mutation, 28 developed skin cancer (3.0%) (OR = 1.83 for BRCA2 versus BRCA1; 95% CI 1.08-3.10; P = 0.02). The odds ratio for basal cell carcinoma was higher (OR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.5-9.4; P = 0.002). BRCA2 mutation carriers are at increased risk for skin cancer, compared with BRCA1 carriers, in particular for basal cell carcinoma.
  BACKGROUND: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are found in a proportion of families with multiple early-onset breast cancers. There are a large number of different deleterious mutations in both genes, none of which would be detectable using standard genetic association studies. Single common variants and haplotypes of common variants may capture groups of deleterious mutations since some low prevalence haplotypes of common variants occur more frequently among chromosomes that carry rare, deleterious mutations than chromosomes that do not. METHODS: DNA sequence data for BRCA1 and BRCA2 was obtained from 571 participants from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study. Genetic variants were classified as either deleterious mutations or common genetic variants. Variants tagging common polymorphisms were selected and haplotypes resolved using Haploview. Their frequency was compared to those with and without deleterious mutations using a permutation test. RESULTS: A common genetic variant in BRCA1 (3232A > G) was found to be over-represented in deleterious mutation carriers (p = 0.05), whereas a common genetic variant in BRCA2 (1342A > C) occurred less frequently in deleterious mutation carriers (p = 0.04). All four of the common BRCA1 variants used to form haplotypes occurred more frequently in the deleterious mutation carriers when compared to the non-carriers, but there was no evidence of a difference in the distributions between the two groups (p = 0.34). In BRCA2, all four common variants were found to occur less frequently in the deleterious mutation carriers when compared to non-carriers, but the evidence for difference in the distribution between the two groups was weak (p = 0.16). Several less common haplotypes of common BRCA1 variants were found to be over-represented among deleterious mutation carriers but there was no evidence for this at the population level. In BRCA2, only the most common haplotype was found to occur more frequently in deleterious mutation carriers, with again no evidence at the population level. CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences in the frequency of common genetic variants of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 and their haplotypes between early-onset breast cancer cases who did and did not carry deleterious mutations in these genes. Although our data provide only weak evidence for a difference in frequencies at the population level, the number of deleterious mutation carriers was low and the results may yet be substantiated in a larger study using pooled data.
  Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes lead to defects in DNA repair processes resulting in elevated genome instability and predisposing to breast and ovarian cancer. The study was designed to detect mutational spectra of BRCA1/2 genes in a Serbian population. Using automated DNA sequencing, we tested individuals for BRCA mutations, based on positive family history of either breast or ovarian cancer or both. Two novel mutations (c.4765_4784del in BRCA1 exon 15 and c.4367_4368dupTT in BRCA2 exon 11) were detected, in three probands from two different families. These mutations have not been reported previously in the BIC or LOVD databases. Protein products of these mutated alleles lack domains necessary for their DNA repair functions, an indicator that these are deleterious mutations. Neither mutation was found in any proband from 50 other families with hereditary predisposition, so the two mutations are likely family-specific rather than population-specific. Although BRCA1-associated tumors are typically negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and ERBB2, the novel BRCA1 mutation identified in this study was detected in a proband with ER- and PR-positive breast cancer. Steroid receptor-positive BRCA-related breast cancer in this proband supports the idea of characteristic pathological features and older age of onset among BRCA1-mutated ER-positive breast cancers.
  Exposure to estrogen has a major effect on breast cancer risk. A polymorphism (-34 T > C; rs743572) in the cytochrome P450c17alpha gene (CYP17A1) encoding an enzyme which controls estrogen levels was reportedly associated with breast cancer risk in average risk populations. The effect of this polymorphism on breast or ovarian cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers has not been thoroughly investigated. With this aim, 2,221 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (1,313 with breast cancer, 279 with ovarian cancer, and 695 asymptomatic carriers), with either BRCA1 (n = 1693) or BRCA2 (n = 528) germline mutations from seven centers were genotyped for the -34 T > C CYP17 polymorphism. Genotyping was accomplished using Taqman allelic discrimination, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) or PCR-based restriction-fragment length polymorphism analysis, and limited sequencing. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer was 1.02 (95% CI 0.89-1.17, p = 0.74) and 1.10 (95% CI 0.72-1.67, p = 0.66) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. The HRs for ovarian cancer were 1.17 (0.94-1.46, p = 0.17) and 0.91 (0.31-2.67, p = 0.86) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. Results remained unaltered when the Israeli cohort (primarily Ashkenazim) was evaluated separately. In conclusion, there was no overall evidence for an association of the -34 T > C CYP17 polymorphism with either breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.
  BACKGROUND: The germline BRCA2 mutation is associated with increased prostate cancer (PrCa) risk. We have assessed survival in young PrCa cases with a germline mutation in BRCA2 and investigated loss of heterozygosity at BRCA2 in their tumours. METHODS: Two cohorts were compared: one was a group with young-onset PrCa, tested for germline BRCA2 mutations (6 of 263 cases had a germline BRAC2 mutation), and the second was a validation set consisting of a clinical set from Manchester of known BRCA2 mutuation carriers (15 cases) with PrCa. Survival data were compared with a control series of patients in a single clinic as determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Loss of heterozygosity was tested for in the DNA of tumour tissue of the young-onset group by typing four microsatellite markers that flanked the BRCA2 gene, followed by sequencing. RESULTS: Median survival of all PrCa cases with a germline BRCA2 mutation was shorter at 4.8 years than was survival in controls at 8.5 years (P=0.002). Loss of heterozygosity was found in the majority of tumours of BRCA2 mutation carriers. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the poorer survival of PrCa in BRCA2 mutation carriers is associated with the germline BRCA2 mutation per se. CONCLUSION: BRCA2 germline mutation is an independent prognostic factor for survival in PrCa. Such patients should not be managed with active surveillance as they have more aggressive disease.
  BACKGROUND: Genomic gains and losses are a result of genomic instability in many types of cancers. BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated breast cancers are associated with increased amounts of chromosomal aberrations, presumably due their functions in genome repair. Some of these genomic aberrations may harbor genes whose absence or overexpression may give rise to cellular growth advantage. So far, it has not been easy to identify the driver genes underlying gains and losses. A powerful approach to identify these driver genes could be a cross-species comparison of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data from cognate mouse and human tumors. Orthologous regions of mouse and human tumors that are commonly gained or lost might represent essential genomic regions selected for gain or loss during tumor development. METHODS: To identify genomic regions that are associated with BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated breast cancers we compared aCGH data from 130 mouse Brca1Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ, Brca2Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ and p53Δ/Δ mammary tumor groups with 103 human BRCA1-mutated, BRCA2-mutated and non-hereditary breast cancers. RESULTS: Our genome-wide cross-species analysis yielded a complete collection of loci and genes that are commonly gained or lost in mouse and human breast cancer. Principal common CNAs were the well known MYC-associated gain and RB1/INTS6-associated loss that occurred in all mouse and human tumor groups, and the AURKA-associated gain occurred in BRCA2-related tumors from both species. However, there were also important differences between tumor profiles of both species, such as the prominent gain on chromosome 10 in mouse Brca2Δ/Δ;p53Δ/Δ tumors and the PIK3CA associated 3q gain in human BRCA1-mutated tumors, which occurred in tumors from one species but not in tumors from the other species. This disparity in recurrent aberrations in mouse and human tumors might be due to differences in tumor cell type or genomic organization between both species. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of the oncogenome during mouse and human breast tumor development is markedly different, apart from the MYC gain and RB1-associated loss. These differences should be kept in mind when using mouse models for preclinical studies.
  Women who do not have a documented germline mutation or who do not have a strong family history suspicious for a germline mutation are considered to be at average risk of ovarian cancer. Women who have confirmed deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations are high risk of ovarian cancer. In addition, women who have a strong family history of either ovarian or breast cancer may carry a deleterious mutation and must be presumed to be at higher-than-average risk, even if they have not been tested, because there could be other mutations that are either untested or yet undiscovered that confirm higher-than-average risk of these diseases. We reviewed studies pertaining to prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women at average risk of ovarian cancer who are undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease. We also reviewed the role of prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in preventing ovarian cancer based on the level of risk of the patient. For women at average risk of ovarian cancer who are undergoing a hysterectomy for benign conditions, the decision to perform prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be individualized after appropriate informed consent, including a careful analysis of personal risk factors. Several studies suggest an overall negative health effect when prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is performed before the age of menopause. Ovarian conservation before menopause may be especially important in patients with a personal or strong family history of cardiovascular or neurological disease. Conversely, women at high risk of ovarian cancer should undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
  The fallopian tube has recently emerged as an important site of origin for not only early serous cancer in women with inherited mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 but as a source of many pelvic serous carcinomas. With this increased attention has come the inevitable need to sort out what epithelial abnormalities are clinically important and how they should be reported by the practicing pathologist. This review addresses 4 categories of tubal epithelial change: (1) metaplasias; (2) nonmalignant atypias; (3) potential precursors, including secretory cell outgrowths and p53 signatures; and (4) tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. A modified protocol for sectioning the fallopian tube (SEE-FIM) is discussed and each of the above topics is covered in the context of its differential diagnosis and recommendations for reporting are included. Finally, the rationale for close inspection of the tube, both in presumed benign and malignant disease, is discussed, with reference to an ongoing multi-institutional web-based project (Pelvic-ovarian Cancer Interception project).
  Hereditary breast cancer syndrome was firstly associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes the mutations of which confer high risk to develop breast and/or ovarian cancer. Double heterozygosity is a rare condition in which both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are present in a family at the same time. In the current study, a family with double heterozygosity has been reported. Furthermore, for the first time a molecular analysis in both proband lineages, maternal and paternal, has been reported to understand the provenience of both germinal mutations.The case regards a woman who developed breast and ovarian cancer with liver metastasis which presented two mutations, each in the two genes, transmitted from her mother and her father, respectively. In this family all available members have been investigated. The concomitant presence of these peculiar mutations was never reported before suggesting a link with Caucasian population from Southern Italy.
  BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor that functions in homologous recombination, a key genomic integrity pathway. BRCA2 interacts with RAD51, the central protein of recombination, which forms filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to perform homology search and DNA strand invasion. We report the purification of full-length human BRCA2 and show that it binds to ~6 RAD51 molecules and promotes RAD51 binding to ssDNA coated by replication protein A (RPA), in a manner that is stimulated by DSS1.
  Individuals with BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to breast cancers owing to genome instability. To determine the functions of BRCA2, the human protein was purified. It was found to bind selectively to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. Monomeric and dimeric forms of BRCA2 were observed by EM. BRCA2 directed the binding of RAD51 recombinase to ssDNA, reduced the binding of RAD51 to duplex DNA and stimulated RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange. These observations provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA2 in the maintenance of genome stability.
  Mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, leads to breast and ovarian cancers. Mechanistic insight into the functions of human BRCA2 has been limited by the difficulty of isolating this large protein (3,418 amino acids). Here we report the purification of full-length BRCA2 and show that it both binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). BRCA2 acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. BRCA2 does not anneal ssDNA complexed with RPA, implying it does not directly function in repair processes that involve ssDNA annealing. Our findings show that BRCA2 is a key mediator of homologous recombination, and they provide a molecular basis for understanding how this DNA repair process is disrupted by BRCA2 mutations, which lead to chromosomal instability and cancer.
  Inactivating mutations of the CHEK2 and STK11 genes are responsible for Li-Fraumeni and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, respectively, both autosomal dominant syndromes associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The PALB2/FANCN gene encodes a nuclear partner of BRCA2 and acts as a linker between BRCA1 and BRCA2. Monoallelic PALB2 truncating mutations were shown to confer higher risk of breast cancer. To evaluate the proportion of French Canadian non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families with high risk of breast cancer potentially harboring alterations in these three breast cancer susceptibility genes, the whole coding and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed in a series of 96 high-risk breast cancer individuals. Despite no PALB2 deleterious truncating mutations being identified, the c.1100delC breast-cancer-associated CHEK2 mutation and a STK11 mutation reported to be the causative mutation in a Peutz-Jeghers family were identified. This extensive analysis also led to the identification of several variants in these genes. Ascertainment of allele frequency of these variants in a cohort of 96 healthy unrelated women suggests a difference in allele frequency for two STK11 intronic variants. In addition, large genomic rearrangements in both STK11 and PALB2 were also examined. Our analysis led to the conclusion that CHEK2, STK11, and PALB2 mutations or large genomic rearrangements of either STK11 or PALB2 are rare, and do not contribute to a substantial fraction of breast cancer susceptibility in high-risk French Canadian breast cancer families.
  OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for the presence of a non-invasive lesion of the fallopian tube in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. METHODS: 173 BRCA mutation carriers underwent a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy at the University Health Network, Toronto between 2000 and 2008 and were evaluated for the presence of a non-invasive lesion of the fallopian tube. Patients were classified as having p53 overexpression ("p53-signature"), a tubal intra-epithelial carcinoma (TIC) or normal tubal epithelium. We obtained a risk factor questionnaire from all patients. We calculated odds ratios for several risk factors, comparing patients with a tubal abnormality to those with normal histology. RESULTS: Of the 173 patients, 43 (25%) were found to have a tubal lesion, including 23% of the BRCA1 mutation carriers and 27% of the BRCA2 mutation carriers. The prevalence of a non-invasive tubal lesion increased with age; an abnormality was present in 5% of women who had surgery before the age of 40 (1 of 12) and in 56% of women who underwent surgery at age 60 or above (6 of 13; p=0.004). A non-invasive lesion of either type was found in 31.2% of women with a BMI > 25 kg/m2) compared to 18.0% of patients with a BMI < 25 kg/m2 at the time of surgery (p=0.05). The average duration of oral contraceptive use among women with normal tubes was 6.0 years, compared to an average duration of 4.0 years for women with a p53 signature (p=0.09) and was 2.7 years for women with a TIC (p=0.0003). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of tubal p53 signature and TIC increases with age at salpingectomy and with BMI. Oral contraceptive use is associated with a decrease in the prevalence of TICs.
  Women with a family history of breast cancer have mutations in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2. Since the discovery of these two genes, around 100,000 women worldwide have undergone genetic testing. The decisions they make based on the results are usually life changing and may involve radical preventive surgeries such as prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectamy. However, not all mutations will lead to breast cancer, and to prevent unnecessary surgery, we are developing assays to determine which mutations adversely affect the functions of the protein encoded by the BRCA1 gene. The functions of BRCA1 are mediated by numerous interactions that are required for cell-cycle and centrosome control, transcriptional regulation and the DNA damage response. Missense mutations that perturb the interactions of BRCA1 will adversely affect these functions and are, therefore, likely to lead to breast cancer. Determining the effect missense mutations have on the interaction of BRCA1 with DNA will form the basis of the assay described in this chapter.
  We describe here a comprehensive and reliable assay to test the functional significance of variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) identified in the human breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2. The assay is based on the ability of human BRCA2 to complement the loss of endogenous Brca2 in mouse embryonic stem cells. The procedure involves generation of a desired mutation in BRCA2 present in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and the introduction of the BAC into ES cells engineered for the assay. These ES cells have one null and one conditional allele of Brca2. First, the effect of the BRCA2 variants on the viability of ES cells is tested by Cre-mediated deletion of the conditional allele. Subsequently, variants that result in viable ES cells are examined for their effect on known functions of BRCA2 using a variety of functional assays such as sensitivity to genotoxic agents, in vivo and in vitro proliferation, effect on homologous recombination and genomic stability. The method described herein allows for the analysis of three to five sequence variants within 2-3 months. This approach can also be used for functional analysis of variants identified in other human disease genes that result in a phenotype detectable in ES cells.
  Selection for genetic testing for pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is an important area of healthcare. While testing costs for mutational analysis are falling, costs of tests in North America remain in excess of $3,000. Most countries state that there should be at least a 10-20% likelihood of detecting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 within a family before mutational analysis is performed. A number of computer-based models have been developed to assess this likelihood, and these continue to be improved to incorporate mutation frequencies, breast cancer incidence and tumour histology. However, these can be time-consuming and difficult to use in a busy clinic. The Manchester scoring system was developed in 2003, and we have continued to validate its use in Western populations. The scoring system discriminates well at both the 10 and 20% threshold for testing and compares very well with more complex computer-based models. However, it should not be used in its current form in founder populations or populations with low incidence of breast cancer, although a lower points threshold could be used to determine an appropriate cut off. The development of the Manchester score and its comparison with other models will be described in this chapter.
  We present the routine diagnostic application of EMMA (Enhanced Mismatch Mutation Analysis, Fluigent), a new, fast, reliable, and cost-effective method for mutation screening. This method is based on heteroduplex analysis by capillary electrophoresis and relies on the use of innovative matrices increasing the electrophoretic mobility differences between homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA, which is further enhanced by the addition of nucleosides in the separation matrix. Nucleosides interact with heteroduplex mismatched bases, hence increasing mobility difference with homoduplex. As separations are performed by multi-capillary electrophoresis, it allows for high automation, low cost, and high throughput. Moreover, EMMA, in combination with limiting PCR conditions, can be used to achieve the simultaneous detection of point mutation and large scale rearrangement in a single run.We now report on the routine diagnostic use of this method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening. The coding sequence and exon-intron junctions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were amplified in 24 multiplex PCRs using a single condition. PCRs were electrophoresed with a single analytical condition on an ABI3100, and data were analyzed using dedicated software (Emmalys).The strength of this new method relies on the following assets: (1) a single condition of analysis: modeling related to melting domain is not required (2) simultaneous detection of point mutations and large scale rearrangements, (3) optimized and ready-to-use polymer that can be used on various ABI sequencers, (4) easy to use, (5) low reagent costs, and (6) throughput.
  Epidemiological evidence from different studies has shown that genes harboring sequence variations may modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Current attempts to identify genetic modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated risk have focused on a candidate gene-based approach or the development of large genome-wide association studies. However, both methods have notable limitations. This chapter describes a novel approach for analyzing gene expression differences to prioritize candidate modifier genes for single nucleotide polymorphism association studies. The advantage that gives this strategy an edge over other candidate gene-based studies is its potential to identify candidate genes that interact with exogenous risk factors to cause or modify cancer, without detailed a priori knowledge of the molecular pathways involved.
  To better understand the alterations present in the group of the so-called BRCAX tumors, we have used a cDNA microarray containing genes related to tumorigenesis and analyzed a series of 49 tumors consisting of 13 BRCA1, 14 BRCAX and 22 sporadic. We have confirmed that the BRCAX tumors are heterogeneous and can be divided in at least two main subgroups, so-called A and B, transcriptionally distinguishable and with different altered pathways within each of the groups. We have found that BRCAX-A and B subgroups, can be classified as Luminal A and Luminal B, respectively, taking into account the intrinsic phenotypes defined for the sporadic breast tumors. We have found that, at the somatic level, the BRCAX-B tumors are identical to their sporadic Luminal B counterparts, whereas BRCAX-A, despite having a Luminal A phenotype, shows additional genomic alterations. We have found 21 deregulated genes in the BRCAX-A group that we have called "the BRCAX susceptibility pathway" and suggested it as a candidate to search for new genes involved in the inherited susceptibility underlying the disease in this group.
  The aim of the present study is to analyze the relationship of the incidence of mutations in the two major genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 conferring risk of breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) with the cancer burden in families and with the presence and age of onset of BC/OC. We included 704 index patients (IP) and 668 family members of the IP who tested positive for BRCA1/BRCA2 who were studied in the Program of Genetic Counselling in Cancer of the Valencia Community (Spain). We found 129 IPs with deleterious mutations (18.3%), 59 in BRCA1 and 70 in BRCA2, detecting 396 mutations in this kindred. The incidence of mutations and their distribution between BRCA1 and BRCA2 showed a significantly uneven incidence among the family groups (P < 0.001). We found 179 tumors in the 396 mutation carriers (45%) and detected only 11 cancers among the 272 non-mutation carriers (P < 0.001). No differences in the tumor prevalence or the age of onset of cancer between the genes among the mutation carriers were found. The mutation carriers showed a 50% probability of having BC/OC at a median age of 49 years (95% CI 46-52 years) and 78% at the age of 70 years (95% CI: 71-85%). In conclusion the family burden of BC and OC is strongly associated with the incidence of BRCAs mutations and could foretell which of the two BRCAs genes is more likely to have mutations. Mutation carriers have a 50% risk of having BC/OC by the age of 50 years.
  DNA-methylating agents of the S(N)2 type target DNA mostly at ring nitrogens, producing predominantly N-methylated purines. These adducts are repaired by base excision repair (BER). Since defects in BER cause accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and sensitize cells to the agents, it has been suggested that some of the lesions on their own or BER intermediates (e.g. apurinic sites) are cytotoxic, blocking DNA replication and inducing replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we addressed the question of whether homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or both are involved in the repair of DSBs formed following treatment of cells with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We show that HR defective cells (BRCA2, Rad51D and XRCC3 mutants) are dramatically more sensitive to MMS-induced DNA damage as measured by colony formation, apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations, while NHEJ defective cells (Ku80 and DNA-PK(CS) mutants) are only mildly sensitive to the killing, apoptosis-inducing and clastogenic effects of MMS. On the other hand, the HR mutants were almost completely refractory to the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) following MMS treatment. Since DSBs are expected to be formed specifically in the S-phase, we assessed the formation and kinetics of repair of DSBs by γH2AX quantification in a cell cycle specific manner. In the cytotoxic dose range of MMS a significant amount of γH2AX foci was induced in S, but not G1- and G2-phase cells. A major fraction of γH2AX foci colocalized with 53BP1 and phosphorylated ATM, indicating they are representative of DSBs. DSB formation following MMS treatment was also demonstrated by the neutral comet assay. Repair kinetics revealed that HR mutants exhibit a significant delay in DSB repair, while NHEJ mutants completed S-phase specific DSB repair with a kinetic similar to the wildtype. Moreover, DNA-PKcs inhibition in HR mutants did not affect the repair kinetics after MMS treatment. Overall, the data indicate that agents producing N-alkylpurines in the DNA induce replication-dependent DSBs. Further, they show that HR is the major pathway of protection of cells against DSB formation, killing and genotoxicity following S(N)2-alkylating agents.
  Drugs that inhibit the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) are showing considerable promise for the treatment of cancers that have mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressors. This therapeutic approach exploits a synthetic lethal strategy to target the specific DNA repair pathway in these tumors. High-grade ovarian cancers have a generally poor prognosis, and accumulating evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or silencing of BRCA1 by promoter methylation, may be common in this disease. Here, we consider how the potential benefit of PARP inhibitors might be maximized in ovarian cancer. We suggest that it will be crucial to explore novel therapeutic trial strategies and drug combinations, and incorporate robust biomarkers predictive of response if these drugs are to reach their full potential.
  Ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) in a young man is rarely reported. Our patient, a 25-year-old man, presented with apparent symptomatic unilateral gynecomastia. He has a strong history of cancer on both the maternal and paternal sides of his family, including breast and lung (maternal) and melanoma, colon, and pancreatic (paternal). His mother tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. There is no information on paternal genetic testing.The patient was treated with left subcutaneous mastectomy. Upon histologic review of the sample, concurrent gynecomastia and dcis were discovered. To date, only 4 cases of gynecomastia and dcis have been described in younger male patients. Because only 30%-50% of patients with dcis eventually develop invasive cancer in the subsequent 10-20 years, dcis prevalence in the general population may be higher than predicted. This case underscores the importance of family history in any patient presenting with a breast mass. Patients must be made aware of the risk, however small it may be, and physicians must remain cautious of cancer in young men with gynecomastia.
  Few studies have reported on the comprehensive BRCA1/2 mutation analyses of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) families of French Canadian descent. Here we report the investigation of 82 families with at least 3 cases of breast cancer evaluated for mutations by DNA sequencing and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. DNA sequencing identified pathogenic mutations in 37 (45.1%) families, of which 70.2% were one of three recurring mutations (BRCA1:R1443X, BRCA2:8765delAG, and BRCA2:E1953X) frequently reported in this founder population; and variants of uncertain clinical significance in 7 (8.5%) families of which two harbored BRCA2:E3002K. MLPA analysis of the 38 DNA sequence-negative families did not reveal any large rearrangements in BRCA1/2. A phenotypic characterization of the cancer families based on pathogenic mutation status revealed that there were significantly fewer very young age at diagnosis breast cancer cases (<36 years) in mutation-negative families (5.9%, 9 of 153) than in BRCA1 (22.8%, 13 of 57; P = 0.0003) or BRCA2 (22.9%, 27 of 118; P < 1x 10E5) mutation-positive families. There were significantly more mutation-positive families (29 of 36, 80.6%) with a very young age of onset of breast cancer case than those that did not (8 of 39, 20.5%) (P < 10E6). The comprehensive mutation analysis of BRCA1/2 suggests that genomic rearrangements are unlikely to account for sequence-negative HBC families and affirms that the presence of a very young age of diagnosis of breast cancer is strongly predictive of mutation carrier status of French Canadian HBC families.
  DNA double-strand breaks resulting from normal cellular processes including replication and exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation pose a serious risk to genome stability, and cells have evolved different mechanisms for their efficient repair. The two major pathways involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells are non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. Numerous factors affect the decision to repair a double-strand break via these pathways, and accumulating evidence suggests these major repair pathways both cooperate and compete with each other at double-strand break sites to facilitate efficient repair and promote genomic integrity.
  Our understanding of hereditary forms of breast cancer has made enormous advances over the past 15 years, based on epidemiological and molecular genetic studies, and the development of a vast number of informative genetic markers. These studies have involved women with both familial and sporadic forms of breast cancer. Genetic susceptibility to breast cancer can involve several modes of inheritance: Mendelian inheritance, mostly involving autosomal dominant mutations with high penetrance and a high risk of malignancy (the BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN and STK11 genes); dominant mutations associated with a lower risk (ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, etc), and multigenic patterns involving common susceptibility variants, i.e., polymorphisms located within predisposing gene loci (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1, LSP1, etc.) or intergenic regions. Other predisposing factors remain to be discovered, as genetic factors associated with a high breast cancer risk (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN STK11, etc) are only found in about 20% of genetically screened breast cancer families. So far, only the first class of genes have found clinical applications, guiding the choice of medical or surgical treatment. More refined individual risk profiles will benefit from genome-wide polymorphic DNA variant studies anda better understanding of the impact of non genetic factors, such as the obstetrical and gynaecological history, and mutagen exposure.
  To investigate the association of expression and promoter methylation of tumor-suppressor genes with risk of ovarian cancer, we conducted a case-control study of 102 patients with serous epithelial ovarian cancer and 100 patients without ovarian cancers. We measured mRNA expression levels (by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and methylation status (by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction) of five candidate genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, hMLH1, MGMT, and DNMT3B) in tumors from the cases and normal ovaries from the controls. We found that mRNA expression levels of the five genes were decreased in tumors than in normal ovaries with 0.39-fold for BRCA1, 0.25-fold for BRCA2, 0.42-fold for hMLH1, 0.45-fold for MGMT, and 0.87-fold for DNMT3B, calculated by the 2(-DeltaDeltaCT) method. Ovarian cancer risk (odds ratios, ORs) was associated with low expression of all genes (2.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.51 - 5.78] for BRCA1, 3.65 (95% CI, 1.82 - 7.30) for BRCA2, 5.25 (95% CI, 2.52 - 10.96) for hMLH1, and 4.72 (95% CI, 2.32 - 9.62) for MGMT) but not DNMT3B. However, methylation status was not associated with gene expression levels in the tumors, except for hMLH1 whose mean (+/- SD) gene expression was significantly lower in methylated (13.0 +/- 7.6) than in unmethylated (31.2 +/- 44.8) tumors (P < 0.001). We concluded that low mRNA expression of these tumor-suppressor genes, likely due to molecular mechanisms in addition to the promoter methylation in some instances, may be a biomarker for ovarian cancer risk in this study population. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings.
  We have previously shown that a 28-amino acid peptide derived from the BRC4 motif of BRCA2 tumor suppressor inhibits selectively human RAD51 recombinase (HsRad51). With the aim of designing better inhibitors for cancer treatment, we combined an in silico docking approach with in vitro biochemical testing to construct a highly efficient chimera peptide from eight existing human BRC motifs. We built a molecular model of all BRC motifs complexed with HsRad51 based on the crystal structure of the BRC4 motif-HsRad51 complex, computed the interaction energy of each residue in each BRC motif, and selected the best amino acid residue at each binding position. This analysis enabled us to propose four amino acid substitutions in the BRC4 motif. Three of these increased the inhibitory effect in vitro, and this effect was found to be additive. We thus obtained a peptide that is about 10 times more efficient in inhibiting HsRad51-ssDNA complex formation than the original peptide.
  BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in Algeria. The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Algerian population is largely unknown. Here, we describe analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 86 individuals from 70 families from an Algerian cohort with a personal and family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to breast cancer. METHODS: The approach used is based on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations screening by High-Resolution Melting (HRM) curve analysis followed by direct sequencing. All samples for which no pathogenic mutation was found were analyzed by MLPA for large deletions or duplications. RESULTS: Three distinct pathogenic mutations c.83_84delTG, c.181T>G, c.798_799delTT and two large rearrangements involving deletion of exon 2 and exon 8 respectively, were detected in BRCA1 gene. Moreover 17 unclassified variants and polymorphisms were detected in BRCA1 gene (6 described for the first time). Two pathogenic mutations, c.1310_1313delAAGA and c.5722_5723delCT and 40 unclassified variants and polymorphisms (14 never described before) were identified in BRCA2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we used HRM and MLPA to identify BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Algerian patients with a personal and family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to breast cancer. The implications of these new findings in regard to genetic testing and counseling are substantial for the Algerian population.
  Studies of the role of germline or inherited genetic variation on cancer outcome can fall into three distinct categories. First, the impact of highly penetrant but lowly prevalent mutations of germline DNA on cancer prognosis has been studied extensively for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations as well as mutations related to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome. These mainly modest-sized analyses have produced conflicting results. Although some associations have been observed, they may not be independent of other known clinical or molecular prognostic factors. Second, the impact of germline polymorphisms on cancer prognosis is a burgeoning field of research. However, a deeper understanding of potentially confounding somatic changes and larger multi-institutional, multistage studies may be needed before consistent results are seen. Third, research examining the impact of germline genetic variation on differential treatment response or toxicity (pharmacogenetics) has produced some proof-of-principle results. Putative germline pharmacogenetic predictors of outcome include DPYD polymorphisms and fluorouracil toxicity, UGT1A1 variation and irinotecan toxicity, and CYP2D6 polymorphisms and tamoxifen efficacy, with emerging data on predictors of molecularly targeted or biologic drugs. Here we review data pertaining to these germline outcome and germline toxicity relationships.
  Recently, a variant allele in the 3'UTR of the KRAS gene (rs61764370 T>G) was shown to be associated with an increased risk for developing non-small cell lung cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, and was most enriched in ovarian cancer patients from hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. This functional variant has been shown to disrupt a let-7 miRNA binding site leading to increased expression of KRAS in vitro. In the current study, we have genotyped this KRAS-variant in breast cancer index cases from 268 BRCA1 families, 89 BRCA2 families, 685 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families, and 797 geographically matched controls. The allele frequency of the KRAS-variant was found to be increased among patients with breast cancer from BRCA1, but not BRCA2 or non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families as compared to controls. As BRCA1 carriers mostly develop ER-negative breast cancers, we also examined the variant allele frequency among indexes from non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families with ER-negative breast cancer. The prevalence of the KRAS-variant was, however, not significantly increased as compared to controls, suggesting that the variant allele not just simply associates with ER-negative breast cancer. Subsequent expansion of the number of BRCA1 carriers with breast cancer by including other family members in addition to the index cases resulted in loss of significance for the association between the variant allele and mutant BRCA1 breast cancer. In this same cohort, the KRAS-variant did not appear to modify breast cancer risk for BRCA1 carriers. Importantly, results from the current study suggest that KRAS-variant frequencies might be increased among BRCA1 carriers, but solid proof requires confirmation in a larger cohort of BRCA1 carriers.
  All forms of life on earth must cope with constant exposure to DNA-damaging agents that may promote cancer development. As a biological barrier, known as DNA damage response (DDR), cells are provided with both DNA repair mechanisms and highly conserved cell cycle checkpoints. The latter are responsible for the control of cell cycle phase progression with ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 as the main signaling molecules, thus dealing with both endogenous and exogenous sources of DNA damage. As cell cycle checkpoint and also DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently mutated, we here discuss their fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Importantly, as current evidence also suggests a role of MAPK's (mitogen activated protein kinases) in cell cycle checkpoint control, we describe in this review both the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2 signaling pathways as well as the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints by MAPK's as molecular mechanisms in DDR, and how their dysfunction is related to cancer development. Moreover, since damage to DNA might be the common underlying mechanism for the positive outcome of chemotherapy, we also discuss targeting anticancer treatments on cell cycle checkpoints as an important issue emerging in drug discovery.
  BACKGROUND:: BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)-mutated ovarian carcinomas may originate in the fallopian tube. The authors of this report investigated alterations in BRCA1/2 tubal epithelium to define the molecular pathogenesis of these carcinomas. METHODS:: Tubal epithelium was evaluated from 31 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with gynecologic carcinomas (BRCA CA), 89 mutation carriers who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), and 87 controls. Ki-67 expression and p53 foci (>/=10 of 12 consecutive staining cells) were scored by 2 investigators who were blinded to patient designations. Expression levels of p27 and p21 were evaluated within p53 foci. Loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1/2 mutation site was evaluated in microdissected p53 foci and tubal neoplasms. RESULTS:: Background tubal proliferation as measured by Ki-67 staining was increased in the BRCA1 RRSO group (P = .005) compared with the control group. Women who had BRCA1/2 mutations had more p53 foci identified per tubal segment than women in the control group (P = .02). Levels of p27 were decreased in 12 of 28 p53 foci from women with BRCA1 mutations and in 0 of 16 p53 foci from controls (P = .002). There was no loss of the wild type BRCA1/2 allele in 5 tested p53 foci. Tubal neoplasia lost the wild type allele in 6 of 6 foci (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS:: The current results suggested a model of tubal carcinogenesis in women with BRCA1/2 mutations. Increased proliferation occurred globally in at-risk tubal epithelium. A mutation in the tumor protein p53 gene TP53 with clonal proliferation and loss of p27 occurred before neoplastic proliferation. Loss of the wild type BRCA1/2 allele occurred with neoplastic proliferation and before invasion. Cancer 2010. (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.
  PURPOSE: The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) is a tumor suppressor gene that was first discovered in a rare ocular pediatric tumor called retinoblastoma (RB). The RB1 gene is essential for normal progression through the cell cycle and exerts part of its function through the family of transcription factors (E2F) and many other intermediaries. In the absence of normal RB1, genomic instability and chromosomal aberrations accumulate, leading to tumor initiation, progression, and ultimately metastasis. The purpose of this report was to identify the molecular pathways that are deregulated in retinoblastoma. METHODS: We compared gene expression signatures of matched normal retinal tissue and retinoblastoma (RB) tumor tissue from six individuals, using microarray analysis followed by statistical and bioinformatic analyses. RESULTS: We identified 1,116 genes with increased expression and 837 with decreased expression in RB tumor tissue compared to matched normal retinal tissue. Functional categories of the cognate genes with the greatest statistical support were cell cycle (309 genes), cell death (437 genes), DNA replication, recombination and repair (270 genes), cellular growth and proliferation (464 genes), and cellular assembly and organization (110 genes). The list included differentially expressed retinal cone-cell-specific markers. These data indicated the predominance of cone cells in RB and support the idea that the latter group of cells may be the cells of origin for RB. CONCLUSIONS: The genes differentially expressed in RB as compared to normal retina belong mainly to DNA damage-response pathways, including, but not limited to, breast cancer associated genes (BRCA1, BRCA2), ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related gene(ATR), E2F, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) genes. In addition, novel pathways, such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling, polo-like kinase and mitosis, purine metabolism pathways were involved. The molecules AHR, CHK1, and polo-like kinases are of particular interest because there are several currently available drugs that target these molecules. Further studies are needed to determine if targeting these pathways in RB will have therapeutic value. It is also important to evaluate the relative importance of these pathways in different cells that make up the normal retina.
  BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) individuals suffer mental retardation with further cognitive decline and early onset Alzheimer's disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To understand how trisomy 21 causes these neurological abnormalities we investigated changes in gene expression networks combined with a systematic cell lineage analysis of adult neurogenesis using the Ts1Cje mouse model of DS. We demonstrated down regulation of a number of key genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression including Mcm7, Brca2, Prim1, Cenpo and Aurka in trisomic neurospheres. We found that trisomy did not affect the number of adult neural stem cells but resulted in reduced numbers of neural progenitors and neuroblasts. Analysis of differentiating adult Ts1Cje neural progenitors showed a severe reduction in numbers of neurons produced with a tendency for less elaborate neurites, whilst the numbers of astrocytes was increased. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that trisomy affects a number of elements of adult neurogenesis likely to result in a progressive pathogenesis and consequently providing the potential for the development of therapies to slow progression of, or even ameliorate the neuronal deficits suffered by DS individuals.
  Metcalfe KA, Poll A, Llacuachaqui M, Nanda S, Tulman A, Mian N, Sun P, Narod SA. Patient satisfaction and cancer-related distress among unselected Jewish women undergoing genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. It is not known to what extent participation in a genetic testing program for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which does not include an extensive pre-test counselling session, influences cancer-related distress, cancer risk perception and patient satisfaction. Unselected Jewish women in Ontario were offered genetic testing for three common Jewish BRCA mutations. Before testing and 1-year post-testing, the women completed questionnaires which assessed cancer-related distress, cancer risk perception, and satisfaction. A total of 2080 women enrolled in the study; of these, 1516 (73%) completed a 1-year follow-up questionnaire. In women with a BRCA mutation, the mean breast cancer risk perception increased from 41.1% to 59.6% after receiving a positive genetic test result (p = 0.002). Among non-carriers, breast cancer risk perception decreased slightly, from 35.8% to 33.5% (p = 0.08). The mean level of cancer-related distress increased significantly for women with a BRCA mutation, but did not change in women without a mutation; 92.8% expressed satisfaction with the testing process. The results of this study suggest that the majority of Jewish women who took part in population genetic screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were satisfied with the delivery of genetic testing and would recommend testing to other Jewish women. However, women with a BRCA mutation experienced increased levels of cancer-related distress.
  The c.156_157insAlu BRCA2 mutation has so far only been reported in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families of Portuguese origin. Since this mutation is not detectable using the commonly used screening methodologies and must be specifically sought, we screened for this rearrangement in a total of 5,443 suspected HBOC families from several countries. Whereas the c.156_157insAlu BRCA2 mutation was detected in 11 of 149 suspected HBOC families from Portugal, representing 37.9% of all deleterious mutations, in other countries it was detected only in one proband living in France and in four individuals requesting predictive testing living in France and in the USA, all being Portuguese immigrants. After performing an extensive haplotype study in carrier families, we estimate that this founder mutation occurred 558 +/- 215 years ago. We further demonstrate significant quantitative differences regarding the production of the BRCA2 full length RNA and the transcript lacking exon 3 in c.156_157insAlu BRCA2 mutation carriers and in controls. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer in carriers did not differ from that of other BRCA2 and BRCA1 pathogenic mutations. We recommend that all suspected HBOC families from Portugal or with Portuguese ancestry are specifically tested for this rearrangement.
  The rs3834129 polymorphism, in the promoter of CASP8 gene, has been recently reported as associated with breast cancer risk in the general population, with the minor allele del having a protective effect. Some of the genetic variants found associated with breast cancer risk were reported as risk modifiers in individuals with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Here, we tested the effect of the rs3834129 del allele on breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers. The rs3834129 was genotyped in a total of 1,207 Italian female BRCA mutation carriers. Of these, 740 carried a BRCA1 mutation and 467 a BRCA2 mutation. Overall, 699 were affected with breast cancer and 508 were unaffected. When considering class 1 (loss-of-function) BRCA mutations, hazard ratios estimated by weighted multivariable Cox regression model, for individuals with at least one copy of the del allele, were 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.99) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers combined, 1.74 (95% CI: 1.24-2.46) for BRCA1 mutation carriers, and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.66-1.80) for BRCA2 mutation carriers. These results suggest that the minor allele del of rs3834129 is associated under a dominant model with increased breast cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 mutations but not in carriers of BRCA2 mutations.
  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the single most deadly form of women's cancer, typically presenting as an advanced disease at diagnosis in part due to a lack of known risk factors or genetic markers of risk. The KRAS oncogene and altered levels of the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 are associated with an increased risk of developing solid tumors. In this study, we investigated a hypothesized association between an increased risk of OC and a variant allele of KRAS at rs61764370, referred to as the KRAS-variant, which disrupts a let-7 miRNA binding site in this oncogene. Specimens obtained were tested for the presence of the KRAS-variant from nonselected OC patients in three independent cohorts, two independent ovarian case-control studies, and OC patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) as well as their family members. Our results indicate that the KRAS-variant is associated with more than 25% of nonselected OC cases. Further, we found that it is a marker for a significant increased risk of developing OC, as confirmed by two independent case-control analyses. Lastly, we determined that the KRAS-variant was present in 61% of HBOC patients without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, previously considered uninformative, as well as in their family members with cancer. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that the KRAS-variant is a genetic marker for increased risk of developing OC, and they suggest that the KRAS-variant may be a new genetic marker of cancer risk for HBOC families without other known genetic abnormalities.
  Comparative effectiveness research has become an integral part of health care planning in most developed countries. In a simulated cohort of women, aged 30-65, who tested positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, we compared outcomes of mammography with and without MRI, prophylactic oophorectomy with and without mastectomy, mastectomy alone, and chemoprevention. Methods: Using Treeage 9.02 software, we developed Markov models with 25,000 Monte Carlo simulations and conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We based mutation penetrance rates, breast and ovarian cancer incidence, and mortality rates, and costs in terms of 2009 dollars, on published studies and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We used preference ratings obtained from mutation carriers and controls to adjust survival for quality of life (QALYs). Results: For BRCA1 mutation carriers, prophylactic oophorectomy at $1,741 per QALY, was more cost effective than both surgeries and dominated all other interventions. For BRCA2 carriers, prophylactic oophorectomy, at $4,587 per QALY, was more cost effective than both surgeries. Without quality adjustment, both mastectomy and BSO surgeries dominated all other interventions. In all simulations, preventive surgeries or chemoprevention dominated or were more cost effective than screening because screening modalities were costly. Conclusion: Our analysis suggested that among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, prophylactic surgery would dominate or be cost effective compared to chemoprevention and screening. Annual screening with MRI and mammography was the most effective strategy because it was associated with the longest quality-adjusted survival, but it was also very expensive.
  Introduction: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is a common procedure for preventing breast and ovarian cancer in high-risk women. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of subsequent breast cancer (BC) in a high-risk population and to identify clinical and epidemiological predictors of BC following BSO. Materials and methods: One hundred and thirty-three consecutive high-risk women, tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations due to family history, underwent preventive or therapeutic BSO at one of the study hospitals. One hundred and three patients had breast tissue at risk and were considered evaluable for the event-free survival analysis. Twenty-five women harbored a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 and 25 in BRCA2 genes. Results: Fifteen cases of invasive BC were diagnosed with a median interval of 49 months after BSO. Multivariate analysis showed that a prior BC after 50 years of age (p=0.004), age over 50 years at the time of BSO (p=0.005), and prior replacement or contraceptive hormonal treatment (p=0.007) were significantly associated with a shorter event-free survival. Conclusion: In conclusion, age at prior diagnosis of cancer, age at BSO and prior hormonal treatment may be predictors of breast cancer after BSO.
  INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of high-risk breast cancer families are not explained by mutations in known genes. Recent genome-wide searches (GWS) have not revealed any single major locus reminiscent of BRCA1 and BRCA2, indicating that still unidentified genes may explain relatively few families each or interact in a way obscure to linkage analyses. This has drawn attention to possible benefits of studying populations where genetic heterogeneity might be reduced. We thus performed a GWS for linkage on nine Icelandic multiple-case non-BRCA1/2 families of desirable size for mapping highly penetrant loci. To follow up suggestive loci, an additional 13 families from other Nordic countries were genotyped for selected markers. METHODS: GWS was performed using 811 microsatellite markers providing about five centiMorgan (cM) resolution. Multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated using parametric and nonparametric methods. For selected markers and cases, tumour tissue was compared to normal tissue to look for allelic loss indicative of a tumour suppressor gene. RESULTS: The three highest signals were located at chromosomes 6q, 2p and 14q. One family contributed suggestive LOD scores (LOD 2.63 to 3.03, dominant model) at all these regions, without consistent evidence of a tumour suppressor gene. Haplotypes in nine affected family members mapped the loci to 2p23.2 to p21, 6q14.2 to q23.2 and 14q21.3 to q24.3. No evidence of a highly penetrant locus was found among the remaining families. The heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) at the 6q, 2p and 14q loci in all families was 3.27, 1.66 and 1.24, respectively. The subset of 13 Nordic families showed supportive HLODs at chromosome 6q (ranging from 0.34 to 1.37 by country subset). The 2p and 14q loci overlap with regions indicated by large families in previous GWS studies of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomes 2p, 6q and 14q are candidate sites for genes contributing together to high breast cancer risk. A polygenic model is supported, suggesting the joint effect of genes in contributing to breast cancer risk to be rather common in non-BRCA1/2 families. For genetic counselling it would seem important to resolve the mode of genetic interaction.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have a 54-85% and 45% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, respectively, and a 18-60% and 11-27% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer, respectively. Oral contraceptives (OCs) significantly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer also in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. The association between OC use and breast cancer risk in these women is controversial. Some studies showed a modestly increased risk especially among BRCA1 mutation carriers. The risk appears to be greater for women who took OCs for at least 5 years and who took OCs before the age of 30 years. Other studies reported that duration of use before first full-term pregnancy has a positive association with breast cancer risk. Salpingo-oophorectomy reduces the risk of coelomic epithelial cancer of 80-95% and the risk of breast cancer of approximately 50%. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers should be encouraged to undergo prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at the age of 35-40 years or when childbearing is complete. Short-term use of hormone replacement therapy may relieve menopausal symptoms and does not appear to affect the breast cancer risk reduction obtained with salpingo-oophorectomy.
  The authors have investigated the expression of the microcephalin (MCPH1) protein to evaluate its prognostic importance in breast cancer. Microcephalin is a damage response protein involved in the regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 mutations are often associated with basal-like breast cancer, which are also often negative for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2. MCPH1 immunohistochemistry was performed on 319 breast cancers prepared as tissue microarray and correlated with pathology, survival, ER, PR, HER2, EGFR, CK5/6, CK14 and BRCA1 expression. After performing continuous data analysis, mean microcephalin expression decreased with increasing grade (P < 0.006). Mean microcephalin expression was lower in ER/PR negative (P < 0.001) and triple negative cancers (P < 0.004). Conversely, an association with HER2-positive cancers was also identified (P < 0.034). Reduced microcephalin also correlated with reduced nuclear BRCA1 staining (P < 0.001). No association was identified with basal markers. After dichotomising the data into low and high microcephalin expression, reduced expression was identified in 29% (93/319) of breast cancers. An association with low expression was identified in invasive ductal carcinomas with breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (P = 0.052). Multivariate analysis of ductal carcinomas showed that microcephalin, together with lymph node involvement and tumour size were independent predictors of BCSS (P = 0.037). Microcephalin expression is reduced in 29% of breast cancers, particularly in higher grade tumours and BRCA1-negative cases. Microcephalin is an independent predictor of BCSS in invasive ductal breast cancer patients and may prove to be a useful biomarker for the identification of aggressive breast cancers.
  Familial breast and ovarian cancers are often defective in homologous recombination (HR) due to mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Cisplatin chemotherapy or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were tested for these tumors in clinical trials. In a screen for novel drugs that selectively kill BRCA2-defective cells, we identified 6-thioguanine (6TG), which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that are repaired by HR. Furthermore, we show that 6TG is as efficient as a PARP inhibitor in selectively killing BRCA2-defective tumors in a xenograft model. Spontaneous BRCA1-defective mammary tumors gain resistance to PARP inhibitors through increased P-glycoprotein expression. Here, we show that 6TG efficiently kills such BRCA1-defective PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors. We also show that 6TG could kill cells and tumors that have gained resistance to PARP inhibitors or cisplatin through genetic reversion of the BRCA2 gene. Although HR is reactivated in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA2-defective cells, it is not fully restored for the repair of 6TG-induced lesions. This is likely to be due to several recombinogenic lesions being formed after 6TG. We show that BRCA2 is also required for survival from mismatch repair-independent lesions formed by 6TG, which do not include DSBs. This suggests that HR is involved in the repair of 6TG-induced DSBs as well as mismatch repair-independent 6TG-induced DNA lesion. Altogether, our data show that 6TG efficiently kills BRCA2-defective tumors and suggest that 6TG may be effective in the treatment of advanced tumors that have developed resistance to PARP inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are essential in preserving the integrity of genome, and it is not unambiguously clear whether the heterozygosity status may affect BRCA1 or BRCA2 functions. This may have implications for the clinical management of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers both in breast cancer (BC) screening modality and in cancer treatment based on DNA-damaging or DNA-repair-inhibiting drugs. We investigated whether lymphocytes carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations displayed an increased sensitivity to radiation or mitomycin C (MMC) in vitro treatments. Peripheral blood from 21 BRCA1 mutation carriers (12 with BC and 9 healthy), 24 BRCA2 carriers (13 with BC and 11 healthy), 15 familial BC patients without detected mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 16 controls without familial history of cancer (5 with BC and 11 healthy) were irradiated or treated with MMC. Chromosomal damage was measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. We evaluated micronuclei (MN) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs). The BRCA2 mutation carriers and familial BC patients without detected mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 showed less basal NPB than BRCA1 carriers and controls. The BRCA1 (+/-) or BRCA2 (+/-) lymphocytes did not have increased frequencies of MN or NPB after irradiation. In contrast, BRCA2 (+/-) lymphocytes presented higher levels of MN after MMC exposure than BRCA1 carriers and controls. The monoallelic BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic mutations seem not to be associated with an enhanced radiosensitivity. The mutation of one BRCA2 allele conferred an increased sensitivity to MMC, presumably because of the role of this gene in the repair of MMC-induced DNA damage. This finding indicates that the MMC-induced MN analysis could be useful in identifying functional deficiencies of BRCA2 or genes related to BRCA2. Since MMC can be used as an anti-cancer drug, these data may be relevant for the management and follow-up of BRCA2 mutation carriers.
  PURPOSE: Increased mammographic breast density is well recognized as a breast cancer risk factor in the general population. However, it is unclear whether it is a risk factor in women with BRCA mutations. We present the results of a nested case-control screening study investigating the relationship between breast density and breast cancer incidence in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women ages 25 to 65 years with known BRCA mutations were enrolled onto a single-center, high-risk breast cancer screening program. Using a computer-aided technique (Cumulus), quantitative percentage density (PD) was measured for each participant on her baseline mammogram by a single, blinded observer. RESULTS: Between November 1997 and March 2008, 462 women (mean age, 44 years; 245 BRCA1 and 217 BRCA2) were screened and 50 breast cancers were diagnosed (38 invasive, 12 ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]). Density was not measured in 40 women of whom four developed cancer (three invasive, one DCIS). Mean PD (+/- standard deviation [SD]) for 376 women who did not develop breast cancer was 34% (23) compared with 31% (21) for 46 women with cancer (P = .51). Logistic regression model of breast cancer incidence and PD revealed an odds ratio of 0.99 (+/- 0.01 SD) for a one-unit increase in PD (P = .44). Results remained nonsignificant in multivariate analysis, as well as when women with pure DCIS were excluded. CONCLUSION: Increased mammographic breast density is not associated with higher breast cancer incidence in women with BRCA mutations. On the basis of these findings, density should not be considered a factor for these women in decision making regarding prophylactic surgery or chemoprevention.
  Mutations in RAD51 gene are believed to be associated with elevated breast cancer risk. However, several case-control studies focusing on the association between RAD51 135G>C and breast cancer risk failed to achieve consensus. To clarify the effect of RAD51 135G>C polymorphism on breast cancer, a meta-analysis was performed. By searching PubMed and EMBASE, a total of 14 case-control studies, containing 12,183 cases and 10,183 controls, were included. The strength of association between RAD51 135G>C polymorphism and breast cancer risk was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). When all the eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, an elevated cancer risk was revealed in additive model (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78; P = 0.044) and recessive model (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.03-1.82; P = 0.032). In subgroup analyses by ethnicity, BRCA1/2 mutation status, and family history, a significant association was found only among BRCA2 mutation carriers (additive model: OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.11-21.83; P = 0.036; recessive model: OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.10-21.67; P = 0.037). Sensitivity analysis did not perturb the results. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that RAD51 variant 135C homozygote is associated with elevated breast cancer risk among BRCA2 mutation carriers.
  Individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer who undergo screening can experience psychological and emotional distress. The objective of this study is to determine whether individuals participating in a pancreatic cancer screening program experience disruptions in risk perception, cancer-related anxiety or emotional distress. A pretestposttest design was used to examine perceived risk and psychological functioning of individuals participating in a pancreatic cancer screening protocol. The screening protocol includes genetic counselling, transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood collection and eligible participants included individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer or BRCA2 mutation carriers. At baseline, participants (n = 198) showed low to moderate levels of risk perception, pancreatic cancer-related anxiety, and general distress. Participants with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) (n = 131) endorsed higher risk perception of pancreatic cancer than the BRCA2 carriers (n = 67) (perceived lifetime risk 42 vs. 15%), but did not differ on cancer worry or general distress prior to the first study appointment. From baseline to 3 months follow-up, no significant time or time by group interactions emerged on risk perception or general distress, but cancer worry decreased over time for the FPC group regardless of the number of affected relatives. Our findings indicate that participation in a pancreatic cancer screening program does not lead to a significant increase in risk perception, cancer worry, or general distress and that participants with high baseline levels of risk perception and distress may benefit from a more comprehensive risk assessment and psychological support.
  Early studies of genetic predisposition due to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have focused largely on sequence alterations, but it has now emerged that 4-28% of inherited mutations in the BRCA genes may be due to large genomic rearrangements of these genes. However, to date, there have been relatively few studies of large genomic rearrangements in Asian populations. We have conducted a full sequencing and large genomic rearrangement analysis (using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification, MLPA) of 324 breast cancer patients who were selected from a multi-ethnic hospital-based cohort on the basis of age of onset of breast cancer and/or family history. Three unrelated individuals were found to have large genomic rearrangements: 2 in BRCA1 and 1 in BRCA2, which accounts for 2/24 (8%) of the total mutations detected in BRCA1 and 1/23 (4%) of the mutations in BRCA2 detected in this cohort. Notably, the family history of the individuals with these mutations is largely unremarkable suggesting that family history alone is a poor predictor of mutation status in Asian families. In conclusion, this study in a multi-ethnic (Malay, Chinese, Indian) cohort suggests that large genomic rearrangements are present at a low frequency but should nonetheless be included in the routine testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2.
  Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1, BRCA2, and multiple other genes predispose to high risks of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Cancer-associated inherited mutations in these genes are collectively quite common, but individually rare or even private. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has become an integral part of clinical practice, but testing is generally limited to these two genes and to women with severe family histories of breast or ovarian cancer. To determine whether massively parallel, "next-generation" sequencing would enable accurate, thorough, and cost-effective identification of inherited mutations for breast and ovarian cancer, we developed a genomic assay to capture, sequence, and detect all mutations in 21 genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, with inherited mutations that predispose to breast or ovarian cancer. Constitutional genomic DNA from subjects with known inherited mutations, ranging in size from 1 to >100,000 bp, was hybridized to custom oligonucleotides and then sequenced using a genome analyzer. Analysis was carried out blind to the mutation in each sample. Average coverage was >1200 reads per base pair. After filtering sequences for quality and number of reads, all single-nucleotide substitutions, small insertion and deletion mutations, and large genomic duplications and deletions were detected. There were zero false-positive calls of nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or genomic rearrangements for any gene in any of the test samples. This approach enables widespread genetic testing and personalized risk assessment for breast and ovarian cancer.
  Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 increase the lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer dramatically. Identification of such mutations is important for optimal treatment decisions and pre-symptomatic mutation screening in family members. Although current DNA diagnostics is able to identify many different mutations, it remains unclear, how many BRCA2-associated breast cancer cases remain unidentified as such. In addition, mutation scanning detects many unclassified variants (UV) for which the clinical relevance is uncertain. Therefore, our aim was to develop a test to identify BRCA2-association in breast tumors based on the genomic signature. A BRCA2-classifier was built using array-CGH profiles of 28 BRCA2-mutated and 28 sporadic breast tumors. The classifier was validated on an independent group of 19 BRCA2-mutated and 19 sporadic breast tumors. Subsequently, we tested 89 breast tumors from suspected hereditary breast (and ovarian) cancer (HBOC) families, in which either no BRCA1/2 mutation or an UV had been found by routine diagnostics. The classifier showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 84% on the validation set of known BRCA2-mutation carriers and sporadic tumor cases. Of the 89 HBOC cases, 17 presented a BRCA2-like profile. In three of these cases additional indications for BRCA2-deficiency were found. Chromosomal aberrations that were specific for BRCA2-mutated tumors included loss on chromosome arm 13q and 14q, and gain on 17q. Since we could separate BRCA1-like, BRCA2-like, and sporadic-like tumors, using our current BRCA2- and previous BRCA1-classifier, this method of breast tumor classification could be applied as additional test for current diagnostics to help clinicians in decision making and classifying sequence variants of unknown significance.
  BACKGROUND: Approximately half of hereditary breast cancers have mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. BRCA1 is a multifaceted tumor suppressor protein that has implications in processes such as cell cycle, transcription, DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling. This multifunctional nature of BRCA1 is achieved by exerting its many effects through modulation of transcription. Many cellular events are dictated by covalent modification of proteins, an important mechanism in regulating protein and genome function; of which protein methylation is an important posttranslational modification with activating or repressive effects. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate for the first time that BRCA1 is methylated both in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tumor samples at arginine and lysine residues through immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Arginine methylation by PRMT1 was observed in vitro and the region of BRCA1 504-802 shown to be highly methylated. PRMT1 was detected in complex with BRCA1 504-802 through in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitated with BRCA1. Inhibition of methylation resulted in decreased BRCA1 methylation and alteration of BRCA1 binding to promoters in vivo as shown through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Knockdown of PRMT1 also resulted in increased BRCA1 binding to particular promoters in vivo. Finally, following methylation inhibition, Sp1 was found to preferentially associate with hypo-methylated BRCA1 and STAT1 was found to preferentially associate with hyper-methylated BRCA1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that methylation may influence either the ability of BRCA1 to bind to specific promoters or protein-protein interactions which alters the recruitment of BRCA1 to these promoters. Thus, given the importance of BRCA1 to genomic stability, methylation of BRCA1 may ultimately affect the tumor suppressor ability of BRCA1.
  BACKGROUND: Olaparib is a novel, orally active poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in homozygous BRCA-deficient cells. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib for treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. METHODS: In this international, multicentre, phase 2 study, we enrolled two sequential cohorts of women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed genetic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, and recurrent, measurable disease. The study was undertaken in 12 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the USA. The first cohort (n=33) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose of 400 mg twice daily, and the second cohort (n=24) was given continuous oral olaparib at 100 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494442. FINDINGS: Patients had been given a median of three (range 1-16) previous chemotherapy regimens. ORR was 11 (33%) of 33 patients (95% CI 20-51) in the cohort assigned to olaparib 400 mg twice daily, and three (13%) of 24 (4-31) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. In patients given olaparib 400 mg twice daily, the most frequent causally related adverse events were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 14 [42%]; grade 3 or 4, two [6%]), fatigue (grade 1 or 2, ten [30%]; grade 3 or 4, one [3%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or two, five [15%]; grade 3 or 4, one [3%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, seven [29%]; grade 3 or 4, two [8%]) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, nine [38%]; none grade 3 or 4). INTERPRETATION: Findings from this phase 2 study provide positive proof of concept of the efficacy and tolerability of genetically targeted treatment with olaparib in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.
  BACKGROUND: Olaparib, a novel, orally active poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, induced synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient cells. A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. FINDINGS: Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair. Toxicity in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar to that reported previously in those without such mutations. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.
  PURPOSE: The prevalence of BRCA(1/2) mutations in germline DNA from unselected ovarian cancer patients is 11% to 15.3%. It is important to determine the frequency of somatic BRCA(1/2) changes, given the sensitivity of BRCA-mutated cancers to poly (ADP ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitors and platinum analogs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 235 unselected ovarian cancers, BRCA(1/2) was sequenced in 235, assessed by copy number analysis in 95, and tiling arrays in 65. 113 tumors were sequenced for TP53. BRCA(1/2) transcript levels were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 220. When available for tumors with BRCA(1/2) mutations, germline DNA was sequenced. RESULTS: Forty-four mutations (19%) in BRCA1 (n = 31)/BRCA2 (n = 13) were detected, including one homozygous BRCA1 intragenic deletion. BRCA(1/2) mutations were particularly common (23%) in high-grade serous cancers. In 28 patients with available germline DNA, nine (42.9%) of 21 and two (28.6%) of seven BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were demonstrated to be somatic, respectively. Five mutations not previously identified in germline DNA were more commonly somatic than germline (four of 11 v one of 17; P = .062). There was a positive association between BRCA1 and TP53 mutations (P = .012). BRCA(1/2) mutations were associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) after platinum-based chemotherapy in univariate (P = .032; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98) and multivariate (P = .019) analyses. BRCA(1/2) deficiency, defined as BRCA(1/2) mutations or expression loss (in 24 [13.3%] BRCA(1/2)-wild-type cancers), was present in 67 ovarian cancers (30%) and was also significantly associated with PFS in univariate (P = .026; HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.96) and multivariate (P = .008) analyses. CONCLUSION: BRCA(1/2) somatic and germline mutations and expression loss are sufficiently common in ovarian cancer to warrant assessment for prediction of benefit in clinical trials of PARP1 inhibitors.
  DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic because they block the progression of replisomes. The Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins, encoded by genes that are mutated in FA, are important for repair of ICLs. The FA core complex catalyzes the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, and this event is essential for several steps of ICL repair. However, how monoubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes ICL repair at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we describe a highly conserved protein, KIAA1018/MTMR15/FAN1, that interacts with, and is recruited to sites of DNA damage by, the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2. FAN1 exhibits endonuclease activity toward 5' flaps and has 5' exonuclease activity, and these activities are mediated by an ancient VRR_nuc domain. Depletion of FAN1 from human cells causes hypersensitivity to ICLs, defects in ICL repair, and genome instability. These data at least partly explain how ubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes DNA repair.
  The 1100delC mutation of the CHEK2 gene was found to be a cause of breast cancer in 2002. The lifetime risk of breast cancer among women with a mutation and with a family history of breast cancer is approximately 25%. These women are good candidates for screening with MRI and for chemoprevention with tamoxifen. It is reasonable to test for this single mutation when women undergo testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2.
  The 'p53 signature' is a benign secretory cell outgrowth in the distal Fallopian tube that shares properties with ovarian serous cancer-including p53 mutations-and is a putative serous cancer precursor. We expanded the precursor definition to all secretory cell outgrowths (SCOUTs) of 30 or more cells and scored normal (N) and altered (A) expression of both p53 and PAX2, a gene down-regulated in ovarian and endometrial cancer. SCOUTs were identified by BCL2/p73 staining in tubes from women with serous carcinoma, inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and controls. SCOUTs were prevalent in both proximal and distal tube and significantly associated with serous carcinoma versus the others (p < 0.001); 89% were PAX2 (A) and 26% were PAX2 (A)/p53 (A) (p53 signatures). PAX2 (A)/p53 (N) SCOUTs were free of p53 mutations; however, 12 of 13 p53 signatures were PAX2 (A). A tubal carcinoma and contiguous SCOUT were p53 (A)/PAX2 (A) and shared the same p53 mutation. SCOUTs are discretely localized alterations commonly containing altered expression of multiple genes within histologically benign tubal epithelium. Geographic distribution in the tube varies by genotype and immunophenotype, from regionally unrestricted (PAX2) to greater likelihood specific area (fimbria) of shared prevalence (PAX2 and p53). This study reveals, for the first time, an entity (SCOUT) that is associated with serous cancer, expands the topography of altered PAX2 expression in the female genital tract mucosa and highlights another potential pathway disturbance involved in early serous carcinogenesis in the Fallopian tube.
  BRCA1/2 germline mutations predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. Large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) have widened the mutational spectrum of the BRCA1 gene, but the frequencies vary in different populations. In this study, we want to determine the spectrum of LGRs in BRCA1 gene in Nigerian breast cancer patients. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used to screen BRCA1 rearrangements in 352 patients who previously tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 point mutations and small insertions/deletions. Positive MLPA result was confirmed and located by long-range PCR. The breakpoints of the candidate rearrangement were characterized by sequencing. A novel deletion of BRCA1 exon 21 (c.5277 + 480_5332 + 672del) was detected in 1 out of 352 Nigerian breast cancer patients (0.3% occurrence frequency). Further analysis of breakpoints revealed that the deletion involves two Alu-elements: one AluSg in intron 20 and the AluY in intron 21. These data suggest that while BRCA1 genomic rearrangement exists, they do not contribute significantly to BRCA1-associated risk in the Nigerian population.
  Tissue sample acquisition is a limiting step in many studies. There are many thousands of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival blocks collected around the world, but in contrast relatively few fresh frozen samples in tumour banks. Once samples are fixed in formalin, the RNA is degraded and traditional methods for gene expression profiling are not suitable. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of the whole genome DASL (cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension, and Ligation) assay from Illumina to perform transcriptomic analysis of archived breast tumour tissue in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. We profiled 76 familial breast tumours from cases carrying a BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutation, or from non-BRCA1/2 families. We found that replicate samples correlated well with each other (r(2) = 0.9-0.98). In 12/15 cases, the matched formalin-fixed and frozen samples predicted the same tumour molecular subtypes with confidence. These results demonstrate that the whole genome DASL assay is a valuable tool to profile degraded RNA from archival FFPE material. This assay will enable transcriptomic analysis of a large number of archival samples that are stored in pathology archives around the globe and consequently will have the potential to improve our understanding and characterization of many diseases.
  Bi-allelic germline mutations of the Fanconi anemia (FA) genes, PALB2/FANCN and BRCA2/FANCD1, have been reported in a few Wilms tumor (WT) patients with an atypical FA phenotype. Therefore, we screened a random cohort of 47 Dutch WT cases for germline mutations in these two FA-genes by DNA sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). Although several cases appeared to carry missense variants, no bi-allelic pathogenic mutations were identified, indicating that bi-allelic mutations in these FA-genes do not contribute significantly to the occurrence of WT.
  The risk of breast cancer for unaffected men who test positive for a BRCA2 mutation is based on very few retrospective studies. We have used both retrospective and prospective analysis in 321 families with pathogenic BRCA2 mutations. Three breast cancers occurred in male first-degree relatives after family ascertainment in 4140 years of follow-up suggesting a risk of breast cancer to 80 years of 8.9%. A second analysis excluding index cases identified 16 breast cancers in 905 first-degree male relatives on which Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed after assigning carrier status. This analysis confirmed that breast cancer risk in men was 7.1% (SE 5.2-8.6%) by age 70 years and 8.4% (SE 6.2-10.6%) by age 80 years.
  Epidemiological studies have shown that one of the strongest risk factors for prostate cancer is a family history of the disease, suggesting that inherited factors play a major role in prostate cancer susceptibility. Germline mutations in BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer with its predominant tumour suppressor function thought to be the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA2 has also been implicated in prostate cancer etiology, but it is unclear the impact that mutations in this gene have on prostate tumourigenesis. Here we have undertaken a genetic analysis in the mouse to determine the role of Brca2 in the adult prostate. We show that deletion of Brca2 specifically in prostate epithelia results in focal hyperplasia and low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in animals over 12 months of age. Simultaneous deletion of Brca2 and the tumour suppressor Trp53 in prostate epithelia gave rise to focal hyperplasia and atypical cells at 6 months, leading to high-grade PIN in animals from 12 months. Epithelial cells in these lesions show an increase in DNA damage and have higher levels of proliferation, but also elevated apoptosis. Castration of Brca2;Trp53 mutant animals led to regression of PIN lesions, but atypical cells persisted that continued to proliferate and express nuclear androgen receptor. This study provides evidence that Brca2 can act as a tumour suppressor in the prostate, and the model we describe should prove useful in the development of new therapeutic approaches.
  BRCA2 and PALB2 function together in the Fanconi anemia (FA)-Breast Cancer (BRCA) pathway. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic BRCA2 and PALB2 mutation carriers share many clinical characteristics. Mono-allelic germline mutations of BRCA2 and PALB2 are risk alleles of female breast cancer and have also been reported in familial pancreatic cancer, and bi-allelic mutations cause a severe form of Fanconi anemia. In view of these similarities, we investigated whether the prevalence of PALB2 mutations was increased in breast cancer families with the occurrence of BRCA2 associated tumours other than female breast cancer. PALB2 mutation analysis was performed in 110 non-BRCA1/2 cancer patients: (a) 53 ovarian cancer patients from female breast-and/or ovarian cancer families; (b) 45 breast cancer patients with a first or second degree relative with pancreatic cancer; and (c) 12 male breast cancer patients from female breast cancer families. One truncating PALB2 mutation, c.509_510delGA, resulting in p.Arg170X, was found in a male breast cancer patient. We conclude that germline mutations of PALB2 do not significantly contribute to cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 cancer families with at least one patient with ovarian cancer, male breast cancer, and/or pancreatic cancer.
  OBJECTIVE: Based on considerable prospective data, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is one of the most beneficial interventions available to reduce ovarian/breast cancer risk in BRCA carriers and high-risk women. The purpose of this study was to describe the initial surgical outcomes and learning curve analysis associated with laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) RRSO with and without hysterectomy. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-institutional analysis of BRCA carriers and women at high risk for breast/ovarian cancer who underwent LESS RRSO with and without hysterectomy in 2009 was performed. Data collected included age, BMI, procedure, operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain scores, and post operative complications. Student t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multivariate linear regression were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were evaluated; 36 (63%) were BRCA1/2 carriers and 38 (63%) had breast cancer. Patients' mean age and BMI were 46 years and 27 kg/m(2), respectively. Most patients were Caucasian (76%), and at the time of prophylactic surgery, 53% of patients were undergoing active breast cancer treatment. Mean operative time was 38.1 minutes (16-80 minutes). All cases were performed successfully via the LESS approach, and there were no surgical complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis was done, and after controlling for study site, previous abdominal surgery, active cancer treatment, and BMI, operative time was only influence by number of cases performed, p=0.019. CONCLUSIONS: LESS RRSO is feasible and safe with favorable surgical and cosmetic outcomes. In our experience, surgical proficiency is possible after 10-15 cases. The LESS approach may be ideal for BRCA mutation carriers and breast cancer patients because of a short convalescence, permitting minimal interruption in any ongoing cancer treatment and the potential psychological benefits from improved cosmesis and pain control. Prospective studies are needed to assess the relative benefits of LESS compared with more conventional minimally invasive approaches.
  BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases affecting women. Inherited susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are considered in breast, ovarian and other common cancers etiology. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been identified that confer a high degree of breast cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: Our study was performed to identify germline mutations in some exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for the early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer in females. METHODS: This study was applied on Egyptian healthy females who first degree relatives to those, with or without a family history, infected with breast cancer. Sixty breast cancer patients, derived from 60 families, were selected for molecular genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The study also included 120 healthy first degree female relatives of the patients, either sisters and/or daughters, for early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer mutation carriers. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of all the studied subjects. Universal primers were used to amplify four regions of the BRCA1 gene (exons 2,8,13 and 22) and one region (exon 9) of BRCA2 gene using specific PCR. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out. Single strand conformation polymorphism assay and heteroduplex analysis were used to screen for mutations in the studied exons. In addition, DNA sequencing of the normal and mutated exons were performed. RESULTS: Mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were detected in 86.7% of the families. Current study indicates that 60% of these families were attributable to BRCA1 mutations, while 26.7% of them were attributable to BRCA2 mutations. Results showed that four mutations were detected in the BRCA1 gene, while one mutation was detected in the BRCA2 gene. Asymptomatic relatives, 80 (67%) out of total 120, were mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of breast cancer. BRCA mutations were found in individuals with and without family history.
  Nowadays, women develop breast and ovarian cancer more and more early. Therefore, gynecologists and primary care physicians encounter the question, whether one of their patients has a genetic predisposition for cancer. They are crucial in initiating a referral for genetic counseling as well as in caring for high risk individuals coming up with questions concerning intensified cancer screening, chemoprevention or prophylactic surgery.This review presents the actual knowledge in these topics and delivers the molecular basis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer mainly due to mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Problematic aspects of the penetrance of these gene mutations are shown and its role in counseling. The important details of the personal and family history, which influence the risk assessment, are pointed out. Tools for the risk calculation are presented as well as criteria for referral for genetic counseling. The important questions, which have to be addressed in pre- and post-test counseling, are discussed. Finally, the options for women with an inherited predisposition in order to reduce their cancer risk are presented. Each of the three management options 'intensified cancer screening', 'chemoprevention' and 'prophylactic surgery' is discussed thoroughly. Recommended cancer screening in male mutation carriers are mentioned as well.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated breast cancer comprises a small but important group of hereditary breast cancer. Testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 has significant clinical and personal implications for the patients in terms of therapy and follow-up of individual family members. The sequencing of the genes is expensive and since the information derived may have a profound effect on the individual and family members, it is important that testing is done only when the risk of carrying a mutation is thought to be high. Over the last decade, researchers have developed a number of statistical models for predicting risk for harboring mutations in these genes and the risk of subsequently developing breast and ovarian cancer. These models usually take into account the type of tumor and age at occurrence as well as family history. Data from pathological analysis show that although breast tumours are heterogeneous, there are histological characteristics that are seen more frequently in carriers of BRCA1 germ line mutations compared to BRCA2 and sporadic breast cancers. A number of authors have suggested that the addition of pathological data to risk algorithms may improve the predictive power of these models and provide a more accurate way of identifying individuals who may benefit from testing. Here we review the pathology of familial breast cancer and assess the evidence to justify the use of pathology in refining risk assessment models.
  INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a profoundly heterogeneous disease with respect to biologic and clinical behavior. Gene-expression profiling has been used to dissect this complexity and to stratify tumors into intrinsic gene-expression subtypes, associated with distinct biology, patient outcome, and genomic alterations. Additionally, breast tumors occurring in individuals with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations typically fall into distinct subtypes. METHODS: We applied global DNA copy number and gene-expression profiling in 359 breast tumors. All tumors were classified according to intrinsic gene-expression subtypes and included cases from genetically predisposed women. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm was used to identify significant DNA copy-number aberrations and genomic subgroups of breast cancer. RESULTS: We identified 31 genomic regions that were highly amplified in > 1% of the 359 breast tumors. Several amplicons were found to co-occur, the 8p12 and 11q13.3 regions being the most frequent combination besides amplicons on the same chromosomal arm. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with 133 significant GISTIC regions revealed six genomic subtypes, termed 17q12, basal-complex, luminal-simple, luminal-complex, amplifier, and mixed subtypes. Four of them had striking similarity to intrinsic gene-expression subtypes and showed associations to conventional tumor biomarkers and clinical outcome. However, luminal A-classified tumors were distributed in two main genomic subtypes, luminal-simple and luminal-complex, the former group having a better prognosis, whereas the latter group included also luminal B and the majority of BRCA2-mutated tumors. The basal-complex subtype displayed extensive genomic homogeneity and harbored the majority of BRCA1-mutated tumors. The 17q12 subtype comprised mostly HER2-amplified and HER2-enriched subtype tumors and had the worst prognosis. The amplifier and mixed subtypes contained tumors from all gene-expression subtypes, the former being enriched for 8p12-amplified cases, whereas the mixed subtype included many tumors with predominantly DNA copy-number losses and poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Global DNA copy-number analysis integrated with gene-expression data can be used to dissect the complexity of breast cancer. This revealed six genomic subtypes with different clinical behavior and a striking concordance to the intrinsic subtypes. These genomic subtypes may prove useful for understanding the mechanisms of tumor development and for prognostic and treatment prediction purposes.
  AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to identify clinical, mammographic or sonographic abnormalities of the male breast that require histological characterization. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and imaging features of 31 male patients with breast lesions were retrospectively evaluated and correlated with core needle biopsy results. RESULTS: Seven of 31 (22.6%) lesions proved to be malignant and 24 of 31 (77.4%) benign, with a benign/malignant ratio of 4.4:1. In the case of a suspicious clinical presentation (firm mass, nipple retraction) and/or the presence of risk factors for breast cancer (BRCA2 mutation, previous breast cancer), core needle biopsy always demonstrated malignancy. All malignant lesions identified on mammography (4 of 7) appeared as a mass. Benign lesions detected on mammography (21 of 24) presented as an area of increased density (20 of 21) more frequently than a mass (1 of 21). CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic features of cancers were not different from those of benign lesions. Clinical and mammographic findings, along with patient history, can be useful in the identification of male breast lesions that require core needle biopsy.
  OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among a large series of women with carcinoma of the fallopian tube. METHODS: Two series of women diagnosed with carcinoma of the fallopian tube were studied. Women identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry who were diagnosed with fallopian tube cancer between 1990 and 1998 and between 2002 and 2004. A second, hospital-based series was identified at Cedars Sinai Medical Centre, Los Angeles, California. These women were diagnosed between 1991 and 2007. Each subject was approached to provide her family history and ethnic background and to provide a blood sample for genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. RESULTS: In total, 108 patients with fallopian tube cancer were recruited (70 from Ontario and 38 from Los Angeles). Thirty-three patients (30.6%) were found to have a deleterious mutation; 23 in BRCA1 (21.3%) and 10 in BRCA2 (9.3%). The prevalence of mutations was 55.6% in Jewish women and was 26.4% in non-Jewish women. A family history of ovarian or breast cancer was positive for 24 women (23.3%); of these, 14 had a mutation (58.3%). Fourteen (14.4%) of the patients had a previous history of breast cancer; of these, 10 (71.4%) had a mutation. 40.3% of the women who were diagnosed with fallopian tube cancer before age 60 had a mutation, compared with 17.4% of the women diagnosed at age 60 and above. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30% of women with fallopian tube cancer have a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The highest frequencies of BRCA mutations were seen in women with fallopian tube cancer diagnosed under age 60, in Jewish women, in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and in women with a personal history of breast cancer. All patients diagnosed with invasive fallopian tube cancer should be considered candidates for genetic testing.
  The nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) represents an important novel target in cancer therapy. The enzyme is essential for single strand DNA breaks repair via base excision repair pathway. Inhibition of PARP-1 exerts "synthetic lethality" effect towards the tumors with defects in DNA repair by homologous recombination, specifically the tumors with mutations in the breast cancer associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Recent clinical data confirmed the early in vitro studies and suggest that PARP-1 inhibitors could be used not only as chemosensitizers but as well as single agents to selective kill tumors with defective DNA repair by homologous recombination. Such concept of "synthetic lethality" for tumors which have lost one DNA repair pathway by targeting a second DNA repair pathway, represents groundbreaking therapeutic strategy. The review highlights our current knowledge and ongoing clinical development/trials of PARP-1 inhibitors. Keywords: PARP-1 inhibitor, BRCA1, BRCA2, DNA repair, synthetic lethality.
  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, including Romania, where its incidence has increased significantly during the last decade. Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of mortality by cancer in women. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are major cancer predisposition genes, responsible for a large percentage of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families. We investigated 17 patients from unrelated HBOC families in north-eastern Romania, screening for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by mutation-specific PCR and by dideoxy sequencing. We identified four BRCA1 and two BRCA2 mutations in the 17 families. The overall mutation frequency was 41% (7/17; 5 BRCA1 and 2 BRCA2). Two mutations (BRCA1 c.2241dupC and BRCA2 c.8680C>T) were novel and not listed in the BIC database. Two recurrent BRCA1 mutations (c.5266dupC and c.181T>G), previously described among Ashkenazi Jewish and Eastern European populations, were also found. Two unclassified variants (UV) were found, one of which was novel (BRCA2 c.4589A>G). Medical follow-up for mutation carriers was implemented. Our study is the first molecular investigation of the role of the BRCA genes in breast and ovarian cancer in Romania.
  Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is detected in between 5% and 7% of women undergoing risk-reduction salpingooophorectomy for mutations in the BRCA1 or 2 genes (BRCA+), and seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of many ovarian and "primary peritoneal" serous carcinomas. The recognition of STIC is germane to the management of BRCA+ women; however, the diagnostic reproducibility of STIC is unknown. Twenty-one cases were selected and classified as STIC or benign, using both hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical stains for p53 and MIB-1. Digital images of 30 hematoxylin and eosin-stained STICs (n=14) or benign tubal epithelium (n=16) were photographed and randomized for blind digital review in a Powerpoint format by 6 experienced gynecologic pathologists and 6 pathology trainees. A generalized kappa statistic for multiple raters was calculated for all groups. For all reviewers, the kappa was 0.333, indicating poor reproducibility; kappa was 0.453 for the experienced gynecologic pathologists (fair-to-good reproducibility), and kappa=0.253 for the pathology residents (poor reproducibility). In the experienced group, 3 of 14 STICs were diagnosed by all 6 reviewers, and 9 of 14 by a majority of the reviewers. These results show that interobserver concordance in the recognition of STIC in high-quality digital images is at best fair-to-good for even experienced gynecologic pathologists, and a proportion cannot be consistently identified even among experienced observers. In view of these findings, a diagnosis of STIC should be corroborated by a second pathologist, if feasible.
  PURPOSE: Although not currently recommended, genetic testing of minors for adult hereditary cancer syndromes, along with risks and benefits, is still being debated. Thus, we evaluated parent opinions regarding BRCA1/2 testing of minors, in general, and hypothetically, for parents' own minor child. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted to assess parent opinions regarding BRCA1/2 testing in minors, along with parent rationale for and factors associated with these opinions. RESULTS: In total, 246 parents at two academic cancer risk assessment programs who underwent BRCA1/2 testing completed the interview (60% response rate). In response to a dichotomous question, 37% of parents supported testing minors. Responses to an open-ended query suggest that 47% support testing minors in some or all circumstances. Parent negative BRCA1/2 test result (P = .02), parent male sex (P = .03), and minority race (P = .01) were independently associated with support of testing minors. In response to a dichotomous question, 44% of parents reported hypothetical interest in testing their own minor offspring. Responses to an open-ended query suggest that 55% would consider, hypothetically, testing their child in some or all circumstances. Parent negative test result (P = .01), less than a college education (P < .01), and older mean offspring age (P = .05) were associated with interest in testing one's own child. CONCLUSION: Parents' opinions regarding BRCA1/2 testing of minors are divided. Given the lack of evidence supporting either the permission or restriction of BRCA1/2 testing in minors, further evaluation of the risks and benefits of providing genetic risk information and genetic testing to minors for adult-onset disease is needed to inform clinical practice and guidelines.
  INTRODUCTION: Five different molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been identified through gene expression profiling. Each subtype has a characteristic expression pattern suggested to partly depend on cellular origin. We aimed to investigate whether the molecular subtypes also display distinct methylation profiles. METHODS: We analysed methylation status of 807 cancer-related genes in 189 fresh frozen primary breast tumours and four normal breast tissue samples using an array-based methylation assay. RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis revealed three groups of breast cancer with characteristic methylation patterns. The three groups were associated with the luminal A, luminal B and basal-like molecular subtypes of breast cancer, respectively, whereas cancers of the HER2-enriched and normal-like subtypes were distributed among the three groups. The methylation frequencies were significantly different between subtypes, with luminal B and basal-like tumours being most and least frequently methylated, respectively. Moreover, targets of the polycomb repressor complex in breast cancer and embryonic stem cells were more methylated in luminal B tumours than in other tumours. BRCA2-mutated tumours had a particularly high degree of methylation. Finally, by utilizing gene expression data, we observed that a large fraction of genes reported as having subtype-specific expression patterns might be regulated through methylation. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that breast cancers of the basal-like, luminal A and luminal B molecular subtypes harbour specific methylation profiles. Our results suggest that methylation may play an important role in the development of breast cancers.
  Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is activated by DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) or at stalled replication forks to facilitate DNA repair. Inhibitors of PARP efficiently kill breast, ovarian, or prostate tumors in patients carrying hereditary mutations in the homologous recombination (HR) genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 through synthetic lethality. Here, we surprisingly show that PARP1 is hyperactivated in replicating BRCA2-defective cells. PARP1 hyperactivation is explained by the defect in HR as shRNA depletion of RAD54, RAD52, BLM, WRN, and XRCC3 proteins, which we here show are all essential for efficient HR and also caused PARP hyperactivation and correlated with an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. BRCA2-defective cells were not found to have increased levels of SSBs, and PAR polymers formed in HR-defective cells do not colocalize to replication protein A or gammaH2AX, excluding the possibility that PARP hyperactivity is due to increased SSB repair or PARP induced at damaged replication forks. Resistance to PARP inhibitors can occur through genetic reversion in the BRCA2 gene. Here, we report that PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA2-mutant cells revert back to normal levels of PARP activity. We speculate that the reason for the sensitivity of HR-defective cells to PARP inhibitors is related to the hyperactivated PARP1 in these cells. Furthermore, the presence of PAR polymers can be used to identify HR-defective cells that are sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which may be potential biomarkers.
  PURPOSE: To define a gene expression profile of BRCAness that correlates with chemotherapy response and outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS: A publicly available microarray data set including 61 patients with EOC with either sporadic disease or BRCA(1/2) germline mutations was used for development of the BRCAness profile. Correlation with platinum responsiveness was assessed in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant tumor biopsy specimens from six patients with BRCA germline mutations. Association with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor responsiveness and with radiation-induced RAD51 foci formation (a surrogate of homologous recombination) was assessed in Capan-1 cell line clones. The BRCAness profile was validated in 70 patients enriched for sporadic disease to assess its association with outcome. RESULTS: The BRCAness profile accurately predicted platinum responsiveness and mutation status in eight of 10 patient-derived tumor specimens and between PARP-inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in four of four Capan-1 clones. When applied to the 70 patients with sporadic disease, patients with the BRCA-like (BL) profile had improved disease-free survival (34 months v 15 months; log-rank P = .013) and overall survival (72 months v 41 months; log-rank P = .006) compared with patients with a non-BRCA-like (NBL) profile, respectively. The BRCAness profile maintained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis, which controlled for other known clinical prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The BRCAness profile correlates with responsiveness to platinum and PARP inhibitors and identifies a subset of sporadic patients with improved outcome. Additional evaluation of this profile as a predictive tool in patients with sporadic EOC is warranted.
  Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus are common abnormalities in mature B-cell neoplasms. Recent findings have also revealed their significant role in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. As a rule, IGH translocations generate transcriptional activation of the oncogene localized in the proximity of the breakpoint. In this study, we describe a pediatric case of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia showing microRNA-125b-1 (MIR125B1) and BLID gene overexpression, resulting from a novel t(11;14)(q24.1;q32) translocation involving IGH. This is the first report describing the upregulation of a microRNA due to its juxtaposition to protein-coding gene regulatory elements and the overexpression of two neighboring genes as a consequence of transcriptional enhancers localized in the vicinity of the IGH gene.
  Several recent studies have examined the function and evolution of a Drosophila homolog to the human breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, named dmbrca2. We previously identified what appeared to be a recent expansion in the RAD51-binding BRC-repeat array in the ancestor of Drosophila yakuba. In this study, we examine patterns of variation and evolution of the dmbrca2 BRC-repeat array within D. yakuba and its close relatives. We develop a model of how unequal crossing over may have produced the expanded form, but we also observe short repeat forms, typical of other species in the D. melanogaster group, segregating within D. yakuba and D. santomea. These short forms do not appear to be identical-by-descent, suggesting that the history of dmbrca2 in the D. melanogaster subgroup has involved repeat unit contractions resulting in homoplasious forms. We conclude that the evolutionary history of dmbrca2 in D. yakuba and perhaps in other Drosophila species may be more complicated than can be inferred from examination of the published single genome sequences per species.
  Genetic and lifestyle/environmental factors are implicated in the aetiology of breast cancer. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on rare high penetrance mutations, as well as moderate and low-penetrance genetic variants implicated in breast cancer aetiology. We summarize recent discoveries from large collaborative efforts to combine data from candidate gene studies, and to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS), primarily in breast cancers in the general population. These findings are compared with results from collaborative efforts aiming to identify genetic modifiers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and tumours from BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers display distinct pathological characteristics when compared with tumours unselected for family history. The relationship between genetic variants and pathological subtypes of breast cancer, and the implication of discoveries of novel genetic variants to risk prediction in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and in populations unselected for mutation carrier status, are discussed.
  Alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer among women in the general population, but its effect on women who carry a BRCA gene mutation is unclear. We conducted a case-control study of 1925 matched pairs of predominantly premenopausal women who carry a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 mutation. Information on current alcohol consumption was obtained from a questionnaire administered during the course of genetic counselling or at the time of enrolment. A modest inverse association between breast cancer and reported current alcohol consumption was observed among women with a BRCA1 mutation (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96), but not among women with a BRCA2 mutation (OR = 1.00; 95% CI 0.71-1.41). Compared to non-drinkers, exclusive consumption of wine was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of breast cancer among BRCA1 carriers (p-trend = 0.01). Alcohol consumption does not appear to increase breast cancer risk in women carrying a BRCA gene mutation.
  The monohaloacetic acids (monoHAAs), iodoacetic, bromoacetic and chloroacetic acids are toxic disinfection byproducts. In vitro toxicological end points were integrated with DNA damage and repair pathway-focused toxicogenomic analyses to evaluate monoHAA-induced alterations of gene expression in normal nontransformed human cells. When compared to concurrent control transcriptome profiles, metabolic pathways involved in the cellular responses to toxic agents were identified and provided insight into the biological mechanisms of toxicity. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery to analyze the gene array data, the majority of the altered transcriptome profiles were associated with genes responding to DNA damage or those regulating cell cycle or apoptosis. The major pathways involved with altered gene expression were ATM, MAPK, p53, BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATR. These latter pathways highlight the involvement of DNA repair, especially the repair of double strand DNA breaks. All of the resolved pathways are involved in human cell stress response to DNA damage and regulate different stages in cell cycle progression or apoptosis.
  Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), characterized by absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and lack of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are typically associated with poor prognosis, due to aggressive tumor phenotype(s), only partial response to chemotherapy and present lack of clinically established targeted therapies. Advances in the design of individualized strategies for treatment of TNBC patients require further elucidation, by combined 'omics' approaches, of the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC phenotypic heterogeneity, and the still poorly understood association of TNBC with BRCA1 mutations. An overview is here presented on TNBC profiling in terms of expression signatures, within the functional genomic breast tumor classification, and ongoing efforts toward identification of new therapy targets and bioimaging markers. Due to the complexity of aberrant molecular patterns involved in expression, pathological progression and biological/clinical heterogeneity, the search for novel TNBC biomarkers and therapy targets requires collection of multi-dimensional data sets, use of robust multivariate data analysis techniques and development of innovative systems biology approaches.
  BACKGROUND: Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives (OC) use has been associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer risk and with a moderately increased breast cancer risk, which tends to level off in the few years after stopping. The association between oral contraceptive and BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations carriers is unclear. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search updated to March 2010 of studies on the associations between OC users and breast or ovarian cancer for ascertained BRCA1/2 carriers. We obtained summary risk estimated for ever OC users, for duration of use and time since stopping. RESULTS: A total of 2855 breast cancer cases and 1503 ovarian cancer cases, carrying an ascertained BRCA1/2 mutation, were included in our meta-analyses, based on overall 18 studies. Use of OC was associated with a significant reduced risk of ovarian cancer for BRCA1/2 carriers (summary relative risk (SRR)=0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.75). We also observed a significant 36% risk reduction for each additional 10 years of OC use (SRR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P trend<0.01). We found no evidence of a significant association between OC and breast cancer risk in carriers (SRR: 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88-1.45) and with duration of use. OC formulations used before 1975 were associated with a significant increased risk of breast cancer (SRR: 1.47; 95% 1.06, 2.04), but no evidence of a significant association was found with use of more recent formulations (SRR: 1.17; 95% 0.74, 1.86). CONCLUSIONS: OC users carrying an ascertained BRCA1/2 mutation have a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, proportional to the duration of use. There is no evidence that recent OC formulations increase breast cancer risk in carriers.
  Breast cancers related to BRCA mutations are associated with particular biological features. Here we report the clinical and pathological characteristics of breast cancer in Chinese women with and without BRCA mutations and of carriers of BRCA1 mutations compared to BRCA2 mutations. Two hundred and 26 high-risk Hong Kong Chinese women were tested for BRCA mutations, medical information was obtained from medical records, and risk and demographic information was obtained from personal interviews. In this cohort, 28 (12.4%) women were BRCA mutation carriers and among these carriers, 39.3% were BRCA1 and 60.7% were BRCA2 mutations. Mutation carriers were more likely to have a familial history of breast and ovarian cancer, high-grade cancers, and triple negative (TN) cancers. Prevalence of TN was 48.3% in BRCA carriers and 25.6% in non-carriers and was 67.7% in BRCA1 and 35.3% in BRCA2 carriers. Estrogen receptor (ER) negative cancer was significantly associated with BRCA1 mutations, especially in those under 40 years of age. BRCA-related breast cancer in this Chinese population is associated with family history and adverse pathological/prognostic features, with BRCA2 mutations being more prevalent but BRCA1 carriers having more aggressive and TN cancers. Compared to Caucasian populations, prevalence of BRCA2 mutations and TN cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers in Chinese population are elevated.
  As single agents, chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are nontoxic and have clinical efficacy against BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient tumors. PARP inhibitors also enhance the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and alkylating agents but will only improve clinical outcomes if tumor sensitization exceeds effects on normal tissues. It is unclear how tumor DNA repair proficiency affects the degree of sensitization. We have previously shown that the radiosensitizing effect of PARP inhibition requires DNA replication and will therefore affect rapidly proliferating tumors more than normal tissues. Because many tumors exhibit defective DNA repair, we investigated the impact of double-strand break (DSB) repair integrity on the sensitizing effects of the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Sensitization to ionizing radiation and the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate was enhanced in DSB repair-deficient cells. In Artemis(-/-) and ATM(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, sensitization was replication dependent and associated with defective repair of replication-associated damage. Radiosensitization of Ligase IV(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts was independent of DNA replication and is explained by inhibition of "alternative" end joining. After methylmethane sulfonate treatment, PARP inhibition promoted replication-independent accumulation of DSB, repair of which required Ligase IV. Our findings predict that the sensitizing effects of PARP inhibitors will be more pronounced in rapidly dividing and/or DNA repair defective tumors than normal tissues and show their potential to enhance the therapeutic ratio achieved by conventional DNA-damaging agents.
  The etiology of breast cancer is associated with several factors, the most important being genetic susceptibility. Both BRCA1/2 and ATM/ATR play a role in DNA repair pathways and breast cancer. The aims of our investigation were to confirm the contributions of the known polymorphisms in these genes and investigate the pattern of their interaction. A total of 360 Han Chinese blood samples were collected from 180 patients with breast cancer and 180 healthy controls. In total, five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in these genes were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Combined effects of paired SNP were tested by the Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method and theory of Information Gain (IG). By MDR analysis, the best model was determined to be a five-locus site model. Interaction tree by the hierarchical clustering method showed that the ATR mutant rs13091637 gave a maximum stand-alone IG value, while the ATM mutant rs611646 showed the lowest IG value but had the top interaction effect. These results suggest that combined effects of the polymorphisms in these genes may confer susceptibility to breast cancer in a Chinese Han cohort (n = 360). Each of the variants, though, performs a different role in the pathogenetic mechanism of breast cancer.
  Missense substitutions in high-risk cancer susceptibility genes create clinical uncertainty in the genetic counseling process. Multifactorial likelihood classification approaches and in vitro assays are useful for the classification of exonic sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, but these currently rely on the assumption that changes in protein function are the major biological mechanism of pathogenicity. This study investigates the potentially pathogenic role of aberrant splicing for exonic variants predicted to encode missense substitutions using patient-derived RNA. No splicing aberrations were identified for BRCA1c.5054C>T and BRCA2c.7336A>G, c.8839G>A, and c.9154C>T. However, RT-PCR analysis identified a major splicing aberration for BRCA1c.4868C>G(p.Ala1623Gly), a variant encoding a missense substitution considered likely to be neutral. Splicing aberrations were also observed for BRCA2c.7988A>T(p.Glu2663Val) and c.8168A>G(p.Asp2723Gly), but both variant and wildtype alleles were shown to be present in full-length mRNA transcripts, suggesting that variant protein may be translated. BRCA2 protein function assays indicated that BRCA2p.Glu2663Val, p.Asp2723Gly and p.Arg3052Trp missense proteins have abrogated function consistent with pathogenicity. Multifactorial likelihood analysis provided evidence for pathogenicity for BRCA1 c.5054C>T(p.Thr1685Ile) and BRCA2c.7988A>T(p.Glu2663Val), c.8168A>G(p.Asp2723Gly) and c.9154C>T(p.Arg3052Trp), supporting experimentally derived evidence. These findings highlight the need for improved bioinformatic prediction of splicing aberrations and to refine multifactorial likelihood models used to assess clinical significance.
  GEN1 was recently identified as a key Holliday junction resolvase involved in homologous recombination. Somatic truncating GEN1 mutations have been reported in two breast cancers. Together these data led to the proposition that GEN1 is a breast cancer predisposition gene. In this article we have formally investigated this hypothesis. We performed full-gene mutational analysis of GEN1 in 176 BRCA1/2-negative familial breast cancer samples and 159 controls. We genotyped six SNPs tagging the 30 common variants in the transcribed region of GEN1 in 3,750 breast cancer cases and 4,907 controls. Mutation analysis revealed one truncating variant, c.2515_2519delAAGTT, which was present in 4% of cases and 4% of controls. We identified control individuals homozygous for the deletion, demonstrating that the last 69 amino acids of GEN1 are dispensable for its function. We identified 17 other variants, but their frequency did not significantly differ between cases and controls. Analysis of 3,750 breast cancer cases and 4,907 controls demonstrated no evidence of significant association with breast cancer for six SNPs tagging the 30 common GEN1 variants. These data indicate that although it also plays a key role in double-strand DNA break repair, GEN1 does not make an appreciable contribution to breast cancer susceptibility by acting as a high- or intermediate-penetrance breast cancer predisposition gene like BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 and PALB2 and that common GEN1 variants do not act as low-penetrance susceptibility alleles analogous to SNPs in FGFR2. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate the importance of undertaking appropriate genetic investigations, typically full gene screening in cases and controls together with large-scale case-control association analyses, to evaluate the contribution of genes to cancer susceptibility.
  A number of models have been developed to predict the probability that a person carries a detectable germline mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Their relative performance in a clinical setting is variable. To compare the performance characteristics of a web-based BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutation prediction model: the PENNII model ( www.afcri.upenn.edu/itacc/penn2 ), with studies done previously at our institution using four other models including LAMBDA, BRCAPRO, modified PENNI (Couch) tables, and Myriad II tables collated by Myriad Genetics Laboratories. Proband and family cancer history data were analyzed from 285 probands from unique families (27 Ashkenazi Jewish; 277 female) seen for genetic risk assessment in a multispecialty tertiary care group practice. All probands had clinical testing for BR.CA1 and BRCA2 mutations conducted in the same single commercial laboratory. The performance for PENNII results were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of sensitivity versus 1-specificity, as a measure of ranking. The AUCs of the PENNII model were higher for predicting BRCA1 than for BRCA2 (81 versus 72%). The overall AUC was 78.7%. PENN II model for BRCA1/2 prediction performed well in this population with higher AUC compared with our experience using four other models. The ease of use of the PENNII model is compatible with busy clinical practices.
  BACKGROUND: Genetic screening of breast cancer patients and their families have identified a number of variants of unknown clinical significance in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Evaluation of such unclassified variants may be assisted by web-based bioinformatic prediction tools, although accurate prediction of aberrant splicing by unclassified variants affecting exonic splice enhancers (ESEs) remains a challenge. METHODS: This study used a combination of RT-PCR analysis and splicing reporter minigene assays to assess five unclassified variants in the BRCA2 gene that we had previously predicted to disrupt an ESE using bioinformatic approaches. RESULTS: Analysis of BRCA2 c.8308 G > A (p.Ala2770Thr) by mRNA analysis, and BRCA2 c.8962A > G (p.Ser2988Gly), BRCA2 c.8972G > A (p.Arg2991His), BRCA2 c.9172A > G (p.Ser3058Gly), and BRCA2 c.9213G > T (p.Glu3071Asp) by a minigene assay, revealed no evidence for aberrant splicing. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the need for improved methods for predicting functional ESEs and the potential consequences of sequence variants contained therein.
  Recent candidate gene and genome wide association studies have revealed novel loci associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. We evaluated the effect of these breast cancer associated variants on ovarian cancer risk in individuals with familial ovarian cancer both with and without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. A total of 158 unrelated white British women (54 BRCA1/2 mutation positive and 104 BRCA1/2 mutation negative) with familial ovarian cancer were genotyped for FGFR2, TNRC9/TOX3 and CASP8 variants. The p.Asp302His CASP8 variant was associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk in the familial BRCA1/2 mutation negative ovarian cancer cases (P = 0.016). The synonymous TNRC9/TOX3 (Ser51) variant was present at a significantly lower frequency than in patients with familial BRCA1/2 positive breast cancer (P = 0.0002). Our results indicate that variants in CASP8 and TNRC9/TOX3 alter the risk of disease in individuals affected with familial ovarian cancer.

  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. One in 8 women develops breast cancer and approximately 30% of all affected women die of the disease. By performing a nationwide screening program in the Netherlands, a mortality reduction of 1.2% annually was achieved. The screening program is for women between the ages of 50 and 75 years; however, women with an increased risk for developing breast cancer are mostly younger. The role of MRI in this particular group of women has been described in different studies. MRI of the breast in this group of women has a higher sensitivity than mammography, but the highest sensitivity is reached by the combination of these two imaging modalities.
  This article provides an overview of the molecular changes associated with inherited gynecologic malignancies and the incorporation of this information in the counseling of individuals at increased risk for developing malignancies, as well as conventional and emerging approaches to the screening of the general population. Cancer genetic counseling and its role in women's health care is examined. The focus is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer; however, cancer predisposition caused by genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 is also considered. The aim is to provide a foundation for counseling based on fundamental knowledge of the genes and their clinical consequences. The reader is then guided through the mechanics of risk assessment for individual patients, concluding with the psychosocial implications of counseling.
  Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha has been studied extensively in familial breast cancers but there are limited data on ERbeta and its isoforms. This is an important issue since many BRCA1-associated tumours are "triple negative" and are resistant to conventional and targeted therapies. We performed an immunohistochemical study of pan-ERbeta, ERbeta1 and ERbeta2 in a cohort of 123 familial breast carcinomas (35 BRCA1, 33 BRCA2 and 55 BRCAX) using a cut-off for positivity at 20% (Shaaban et al. in Clin Cancer Res 14:5228-5235, 2008). BRCA1 cancers were more likely to be nuclear ERalpha negative and nuclear pan-ERbeta positive (21/32, 66%) when compared with BRCA2 (2/29, 7%) and BRCAX cancers (11/49, 22%) (both P < 0.001). For survival analysis, expression was also stratified using cut-offs defined by Bates et al. (Breast Cancer Res Treat 111:453-459, 2008) (score out of 7). Cytoplasmic ERbeta2 expression correlated with shorter overall survival at 15 years regardless of cut-off used (both P < 0.046) At a cut-off score of 6 out of 7, cytoplasmic ERbeta2 expression correlated with a poorer response to chemotherapy in both univariate (P = 0.011) and multivariate analyses including grade, lymph node status and chemotherapy as an interaction variable (P = 0.045, Hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.004-9.87). A similar trend was seen in a univariate analysis with a cut-off of 20% although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.057). Expression of nuclear ERbeta1 was associated with a favourable response to endocrine therapy at 15 years regardless of cut-offs employed (both P < 0.025). However, this did not reach statistical significance in a multivariate analysis (P > 0.05). Since a significant proportion of ERalpha negative familial breast carcinomas are positive for nuclear ERbeta1 and cytoplasmic ERbeta2, the different ERbeta isoforms and their intracellular location may need to be assessed, to identify patients that may benefit from hormonal and chemotherapy.
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ovarian cancer remains the gynaecological malignancy with the highest mortality in the Western world. The strategy of identifying biologically distinct subgroups of ovarian cancer by means of clinical characteristics, histology and molecular profiling is an exciting prospect in personalizing and improving therapy for ovarian cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical recognition that BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated tumours are very sensitive to inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a key molecule in DNA repair, led to ovarian cancer patients with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations being treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436; KuDOS/Astra-Zeneca). The initial trials of olaparib in this patient population demonstrated an impressive rate of clinical benefit. Furthermore, tumours from patients with sporadic ovarian cancer have been found to commonly have somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations or other defects in DNA repair, with the implication that PARP inhibition may also have a role in treating these patients. SUMMARY: In this review, we discuss DNA repair mechanisms and strategies used to target them in oncology, our current experience with PARP inhibition in BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutation associated and sporadic ovarian cancer, as well as current issues in the clinical development of these agents.
  Mutations of the PALB2 tumor suppressor gene in humans are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and also some other cancers. In the present study, we have characterized mice deficient in Palb2. The data show that the Palb2((+/-)) mice are normal and fertile, and lack macroscopic tumors when followed up till the age of 8 months. Homozygous (HO) Palb2((-/-)) mice present with embryonic lethality and die at E9.5 at the latest. The mutant embryos are smaller in size, developmentally retarded and display defective mesoderm differentiation after gastrulation. In Palb2((-/-)) embryos, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is increased, and Palb2((-/-)) blastocysts show a growth defect in vitro. Hence, the phenotype of the Palb2((-/-)) mice in many regards resembles those previously reported for Brca1 and Brca2 knockout mice. The similarity in the phenotypes between Palb2, Brca1 and Brca2 knockout mice further supports the functional relationship shown in vitro for these three proteins. Accordingly, our data in vivo suggest that a key function for PALB2 is to interact with and to build up appropriate communication between BRCA1 and BRCA2, thereby licensing the successful performance of the physiological tasks mediated by these two proteins, particularly in homologous recombination and in proper DNA damage response signaling.
  INTRODUCTION: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer high risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The risk prediction algorithm BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) may be used to compute the probabilities of carrying mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and help to target mutation screening. Tumours from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers display distinctive pathological features that could be used to better discriminate between BRCA1 mutation carriers, BRCA2 mutation carriers and noncarriers. In particular, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative status, triple-negative (TN) status, and expression of basal markers are predictive of BRCA1 mutation carrier status. METHODS: We extended BOADICEA by treating breast cancer subtypes as distinct disease end points. Age-specific expression of phenotypic markers in a series of tumours from 182 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 62 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 109 controls from the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium, and over 300,000 tumours from the general population obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results database, were used to calculate age-specific and genotype-specific incidences of each disease end point. The probability that an individual carries a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation given their family history and tumour marker status of family members was computed in sample pedigrees. RESULTS: The cumulative risk of ER-negative breast cancer by age 70 for BRCA1 mutation carriers was estimated to be 55% and the risk of ER-positive disease was 18%. The corresponding risks for BRCA2 mutation carriers were 21% and 44% for ER-negative and ER-positive disease, respectively. The predicted BRCA1 carrier probabilities among ER-positive breast cancer cases were less than 1% at all ages. For women diagnosed with breast cancer below age 50 years, these probabilities rose to more than 5% in ER-negative breast cancer, 7% in TN disease and 24% in TN breast cancer expressing both CK5/6 and CK14 cytokeratins. Large differences in mutation probabilities were observed by combining ER status and other informative markers with family history. CONCLUSIONS: This approach combines both full pedigree and tumour subtype data to predict BRCA1/2 carrier probabilities. Prediction of BRCA1/2 carrier status, and hence selection of women for mutation screening, may be substantially improved by combining tumour pathology with family history of cancer.
  The nucleoside analog 2'-C-cyano-2'-deoxy-1-β-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl-cytosine (CNDAC), currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, has a novel action mechanism of causing a single-strand break after its incorporation into DNA. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated thereafter in vivo and, if not repaired, pose lethal impact on cell survival. This study sought to define the mechanisms by which CNDAC-induced DSBs are formed and repaired. We demonstrated that single-strand breaks induced by CNDAC incorporation into DNA were converted to DSBs when cells progressed into the subsequent S-phase. CNDAC-induced DSBs were products of replication, rather than a consequence of apoptosis. ATM, the activator of homologous recombination (HR), was essential for cell survival after CNDAC treatment in cell lines and in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples, as were the HR components, Rad51, Xrcc3, and Brca2. Furthermore, formation of sister chromatid exchanges, a hallmark of HR, increased significantly after CNDAC-treated cells had progressed into a second replication cycle. In contrast, neither the replication stress sensor ATR nor DNA-PK, the initiator of nonhomologous end-joining of DSB, was involved in repair of CNDAC-induced damage. Together, these results indicate that HR, but not nonhomologous end-joining, is the major repair or survival mechanism for DNA damage caused by CNDAC.
  BACKGROUND: In total, 5-10% of all breast cancer cases are related to gen mutations. In most cases a mutation in the BRCA1-gen and BRCA2-gen is responsible for insufficient repair of DNA damages that cause breast and ovarian cancer. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT: In patients carrying BRCA1-mutation the risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer is 87% and 40% as well as 47% and 20% for those carrying a BRCA2-mutation. Women at hereditary risk should be informed about existing recommendations for surveillance. Primary prevention of breast and ovarian cancer including prophylactic surgery (bilateral salpingoophorectomy and bilateral mastectomy) should be explained to mutation carriers. The issue of oral antihormonal therapy for prevention of breast cancer should be addressed. Psycho-social support should be offered to mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutation carriers is very challenging and should be done in centres specialized in this issue.
  Telephone disclosure of BRCA1/2 molecular genetic test results has been proposed as a feasible alternative to traditional in-person results disclosure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between method of result disclosure with the patient outcome variables of knowledge, cancer worry, cancer risk perception, satisfaction, and cancer screening and prophylactic surgery behaviors. Study participants included 228 women who completed retrospective, self-administered, mailed surveys regarding their pre-test genetic counseling and results disclosure. No significant relationships were found between result disclosure method and the outcome variables investigated. A majority (90%) of individuals who received positive results by telephone returned for follow up visits. Factors which genetic counselors believed influenced their clinical decision to offer telephone disclosure, such as history of breast cancer, a priori risk of genetic mutation and family history of known mutation were not shown to significantly impact the actual disclosure method. This study suggests that telephone results disclosure is clinically appropriate when counselors utilize their clinical judgment to determine which patients are appropriate candidates.
  BACKGROUND: A novel oncogenetic clinic was established in 2002 at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust offering advice and specialist follow-up for families with a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remit of this multidisciplinary clinic, staffed by individuals in both oncology and genetics, is to provide individualised screening recommendations, support in decision making, risk reducing strategies, cascade testing, and an extensive research portfolio. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate uptake of genetic testing, risk reducing surgery and cancer prevalence in 346 BRCA1/BRCA2 families seen between January 1996 and December 2006. RESULTS: 661 individuals attended the clinic and 406 mutation carriers were identified; 85.8% mutation carriers have chosen to attend for annual follow-up. 70% of mutation carriers elected for risk reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO). 32% of unaffected women chose risk reducing bilateral mastectomy. 32% of women with breast cancer chose contralateral risk reducing mastectomy at time of diagnosis. Some women took over 8 years to decide to have surgery. 91% of individuals approached agreed to participate in research programmes. INTERPRETATION: A novel specialist clinic for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers has been successfully established. The number of mutation positive families is increasing. This, and the high demand for RRBSO in women over 40, is inevitably going to place an increasing demand on existing health resources. Our clinic model has subsequently been adopted in other centres and this will greatly facilitate translational studies and provide a healthcare structure for management and follow-up of such people who are at a high cancer risk.
  BACKGROUND: Previous publications and utilisation of risk models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation identification suggests that multiple primary disease in an individual is a strong predictor of a BRCA1/2 mutation and that this is more predictive than the same cancers occurring in close relatives. METHODS: This study assessed the pathological mutation detection rates for BRCA1, BRCA2 and the CHEK2c.1100 delC mutation in 2022 women with breast cancer, including 100 with breast/ovary double primary and 255 with bilateral breast cancer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Although detection rates for mutations in BRCA1/2 are high at 49% for breast/ovarian double primary and 34% for bilateral breast cancer, the differential effect of multiple primaries in an individual appears to have been overestimated, particularly in those families with only a few malignancies. Nonetheless, bilateral breast cancer does differentially enhance detection rates in strong familial aggregations. CHEK2 1100 DelC mutation rates were lower in bilateral than for unilateral cases at 0.8% compared to 2%. The detected mutation rates for isolated double primary breast and ovarian cancer was 14% (3/22) compared to 17% (17/99) for the same two primaries in two close relatives in families with no other cases of breast/ovarian cancer. Risk models may need to be adjusted if further studies corroborate these findings.
  BACKGROUND: Several founder mutations leading to increased risk of cancer among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals have been identified, and some estimates of the age of the mutations have been published. A variety of different methods have been used previously to estimate the age of the mutations. Here three datasets containing genotype information near known founder mutations are reanalyzed in order to compare three approaches for estimating the age of a mutation. The methods are: (a) the single marker method used by Risch et al., (1995); (b) the intra-allelic coalescent model known as DMLE, and (c) the Goldgar method proposed in Neuhausen et al. (1996), and modified slightly by our group. The three mutations analyzed were MSH2*1906 G->C, APC*I1307K, and BRCA2*6174delT. RESULTS: All methods depend on accurate estimates of inter-marker recombination rates. The modified Goldgar method allows for marker mutation as well as recombination, but requires prior estimates of the possible haplotypes carrying the mutation for each individual. It does not incorporate population growth rates. The DMLE method simultaneously estimates the haplotypes with the mutation age, and builds in the population growth rate. The single marker estimates, however, are more sensitive to the recombination rates and are unstable. Mutation age estimates based on DMLE are 16.8 generations for MSH2 (95% credible interval (13, 23)), 106 generations for I1037K (86-129), and 90 generations for 6174delT (71-114). CONCLUSIONS: For recent founder mutations where marker mutations are unlikely to have occurred, both DMLE and the Goldgar method can give good results. Caution is necessary for older mutations, especially if the effective population size may have remained small for a long period of time.
  Patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are predisposed to breast cancer. The BRCA1-associated breast cancers have distinct morphology, being more often medullary-like, triple negative and showing a 'basal' phenotype. On the other hand, BRCA2 and BRCAX cancers are a heterogeneous group without a specific phenotype. When incorporated into risk assessment models, pathology data improves prediction of carrier status. The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA repair is being exploited to develop novel therapies, for example, using the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors. A number of low-to-moderate-penetrant genes/loci have also been identified, but their role and contribution in breast cancer development is still under investigation.
  A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of RAD51, 135G>C (rs1801320), was reported to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among BRCA2 as well as BRCA1 carriers. A few studies have also investigated the genetic contribution of RAD51 135G>C to the risk of sporadic breast cancers or breast cancer in non-BRCA1/2 carriers, though the results are yet controversial and inconclusive. We, in this study, performed a more precise estimation of the relationship between 135G>C and breast cancer among non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers by meta-analyzing the currently available evidence from the literature. A total of 12 studies involving 7,065 cases and 6,981 controls were identified. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. When all the studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, there was no evidence for a significant association between 135G>C and breast cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (for CC vs. GG: OR = 0.995, 95%CI: 0.741-1.336; for GC vs. GG: OR = 0.959, 95%CI: 0.869-1.057; for dominant model: OR = 0.988, 95%CI: 0.902-1.082; and for recessive model: OR = 1.037, 95%CI: 0.782-1.376). We also performed subgroup analysis by ethnicity (Caucasian) as well as did analysis using the studies fulfilling Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the results did not change. In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests that the RAD51 135G>C does not modify breast cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
  BACKGROUND: Women who carry germline mutations in the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are at very high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. Both genes are tumour suppressor genes that protect all cells from deregulation, and there are reports of their involvement in other cancers that vary and seem to depend on the population investigated. It is therefore important to investigate the other associated cancers in different populations to assist with risk assessments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cancer risk profile in BRCA-mutation-positive and negative South African breast-ovarian cancer families, mainly of Caucasian origin. DESIGN: Descriptive study in which the prevalence of all cancers in the pedigrees of BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutation-positive groups and a group of families without mutations in either gene were compared with the general population. RESULTS: As expected, female breast and ovarian cancer was significantly increased in all three groups. Furthermore, male breast cancer was significantly elevated in the BRCA2-positive and BRCA-negative groups. Stomach cancer prevalence was significantly elevated in the BRCA2-positive families compared with the general population. CONCLUSIONS: These results can be applied in estimation of cancer risks and may contribute to more comprehensive counselling of mutation-positive Caucasian breast and/or ovarian cancer families.
  Accumulating evidence suggests that many cancers, including BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancers, are deficient in DNA repair processes. Both hereditary and sporadic breast cancers have been found to have significant downregulation of repair factors. This has provided opportunities to exploit DNA repair deficiencies, whether acquired or inherited. Here, we review efforts to exploit DNA repair deficiencies in tumors, with a focus on breast cancer. A variety of agents, including PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors, are currently under investigation in clinical trials and available results will be reviewed.

  Multifactorial models developed for BRCA1/2 variant classification have proved very useful for delineating BRCA1/2 variants associated with very high risk of cancer, or with little clinical significance. Recent linkage of this quantitative assessment of risk to clinical management guidelines has provided a basis to standardize variant reporting, variant classification and management of families with such variants, and can theoretically be applied to any disease gene. As proof of principle, the multifactorial approach already shows great promise for application to the evaluation of mismatch repair gene variants identified in families with suspected Lynch syndrome. However there is need to be cautious of the noted limitations and caveats of the current model, some of which may be exacerbated by differences in ascertainment and biological pathways to disease for different cancer syndromes.
  Mutations in the two breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Patients with mutations in both genes are rarely reported and often involve Ashkenazi founder mutations. Here we report the first identification of a Danish breast and ovarian cancer family heterozygote for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The BRCA1 nucleotide 5215G > A/c.5096G > A mutation results in the missense mutation Arg1699Gln, while the BRCA2 nucleotide 859 + 4A > G/c.631 + 4A > G is novel. Exon trapping experiments and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that the BRCA2 mutation results in skipping of exon 7, thereby introducing a frameshift and a premature stop codon. We therefore classify the mutation as disease causing. Since the BRCA1 Arg1699Gln mutation is also suggested to be disease-causing, we consider this family double heterozygote for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
  Growth and differentiation of colonic epithelium are regulated in the three-dimensional (3D) physiological architecture, colonic crypt, and deregulation of 3D interactions is involved in tumorigenesis. Cell-based 3D culture systems provide a suitable approach bridging the gap between two-dimensional (2D) culture and animal models. KRAS mutations are found at high frequencies in human colorectal cancer (CRC); however, KRAS-targeted cancer therapy has not been developed. Here, we have established a 3D cell culture model resembling the colonic crypt by use of HKe3 cells, human CRC HCT116 cells disrupted at activated KRAS. In this 3D colonic crypt model, HKe3 cells showed the features of time course-dependent transit-amplifying and terminal-differentiated stages, which are characteristic of normal colonic crypt. On the basis of the features of HCT116 cells, activated KRAS inhibited normal cell polarity and apoptosis in 3D culture. The expression of DNA repair-related tumor suppressor genes including TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, and EXO-1 was markedly suppressed by activated KRAS in 3D culture but not in 2D culture. These results together suggest that activated KRAS plays critical roles in the accumulation of genetic alterations through inhibition of DNA repair genes and apoptosis and that this 3D culture model will provide a useful tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of CRC development.
  Germ-line mutations in breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) result in predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1-mutated tumors show genomic instability, mainly as a consequence of impaired recombinatorial DNA repair. Here we identify p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) as an essential factor for sustaining the growth arrest induced by Brca1 deletion. Depletion of 53BP1 abrogates the ATM-dependent checkpoint response and G2 cell-cycle arrest triggered by the accumulation of DNA breaks in Brca1-deleted cells. This effect of 53BP1 is specific to BRCA1 function, as 53BP1 depletion did not alleviate proliferation arrest or checkpoint responses in Brca2-deleted cells. Notably, loss of 53BP1 partially restores the homologous-recombination defect of Brca1-deleted cells and reverts their hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. We find reduced 53BP1 expression in subsets of sporadic triple-negative and BRCA-associated breast cancers, indicating the potential clinical implications of our findings.
  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for fallopian tube cancer in women with and without a BRCA mutation. METHODS: Subjects with fallopian tube cancer were identified from two sources: 1) a large international registry of women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n=56), and; 2) a population-based study of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer conducted in Ontario, Canada (n=66). BRCA mutation status was established for all subjects. Each subject was matched to one or more unaffected controls, for date of birth (within four years), for BRCA mutation status (negative, BRCA1, and BRCA2), for country of residence and for past history of breast cancer (yes/no). All subjects completed a questionnaire about medical history and lifestyle factors. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for parity, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, hormone replacement therapy and body mass index, using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We studied 103 women with fallopian tube cancer (48 with a BRCA1 mutation, 12 with a BRCA2 mutation and 43 with no identified BRCA mutation) and 980 matched controls. Increasing parity was associated with a decreased risk of fallopian tube cancer in non-carriers (trend per birth odds ratio 0.71 (95% CI 0.52-0.97), p=0.03), in BRCA1 carriers (OR=0.79 (0.62-1.02) p=0.07) and in BRCA2 carriers (OR=0.62 (0.34-1.15), p=0.13), but was statistically significant only for non-carriers. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a reduced risk in BRCA1 carriers (trend per year of use odds ratio=0.91 (0.83-0.99), p=0.03) but not for non-carriers (OR=0.97 (0.87-1.09), p=0.64) or for BRCA2 carriers (OR=0.94 (0.80-1.11), p=0.47). Hormone replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk for fallopian tube cancer in all subjects (OR=1.07 (1.01-1.13), p=0.03), and in the subgroups stratified by mutation, however the association was not significant in the subgroups. Tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk of fallopian tube cancer for all subjects (OR=0.64 (0.31-1.28), p=0.21), however the reduction was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Parity and oral contraceptive use are associated with reduced risks of fallopian tube cancer. In contrast, hormone replacement therapy may be associated with an increase in the risk of fallopian tube cancer.
  BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer has been on the rise in Malaysia. It is suggested that a subset of breast cancer cases were associated with germline mutation in breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes. Most of the BRCA mutations reported in Malaysia were point mutations, small deletions and insertions. Here we report the first study of BRCA large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in Malaysia. We aimed to detect the presence of LGRs in the BRCA genes of Malaysian patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for BRCA LGRs was carried out on 100 patients (60 were high-risk breast cancer patients previously tested negative/positive for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and 40 were sporadic breast cancer patients), recruited from three major referral centres, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Putrajaya (HPJ). Results: Two novel BRCA1 rearrangements were detected in patients with sporadic breast cancer; both results were confirmed by quantitative PCR. No LGRs were found in patients with high-risk breast cancer. The two large genomic rearrangements detected were genomic amplifications of exon 3 and exon 10. No BRCA2 genomic rearrangement was found in both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: These results will be helpful to understand the mutation spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Malaysian patients with breast cancer. Further studies involving larger samples are required to establish a genetic screening strategy for both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients.
  The Fanconi anaemia (FA) FANCG protein is an integral component of the FA nuclear core complex that is required for monoubiquitylation of FANCD2. FANCG is also part of another protein complex termed D1-D2-G-X3 that contains FANCD2 and the homologous recombination repair proteins BRCA2 (FANCD1) and XRCC3. Formation of the D1-D2-G-X3 complex is mediated by serine-7 phosphorylation of FANCG and occurs independently of the FA core complex and FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. FANCG contains seven tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions and here we show that mutation of several of the TPR motifs at a conserved consensus residue ablates the in vivo binding activity of FANCG. Expression of mutated TPR1, TPR2, TPR5 and TPR6 in Chinese hamster fancg mutant NM3 fails to functionally complement its hypersensitivities to mitomycin C (MMC) and phleomycin and fails to restore FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that these TPR-mutated FANCG proteins fail to interact with BRCA2, XRCC3, FANCA or FANCF. The interactions of other proteins in the D1-D2-G-X3 complex are also absent, including the interaction of BRCA2 with both the monoubiquitylated (FANCD2-L) and non-ubiquitylated (FANCD2-S) isoforms of FANCD2. Interestingly, a mutation of TPR7 (R563E), that complements the MMC and phleomycin hypersensitivity of human FA-G EUFA316 cells, fails to complement NM3, despite the mutated FANCG protein co-precipitating with FANCA, BRCA2 and XRCC3. Whilst interaction of TPR7-mutated FANCG with FANCF does appear to be reduced in NM3, FANCD2 is monoubiquitylated suggesting that sub-optimal interactions of FANCG in the core complex and the D1-D2-G-X3 complex are responsible for the observed MMC- and phleomycin-hypersensitivity, rather than a defect in FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. Our data demonstrate that FANCG functions as a mediator of protein-protein interactions and is vital for the assembly of multi-protein complexes including the FA core complex and the D1-D2-G-X3 complex.
  Recently, TRAIL function has been elucidated beyond its known classical role of mediating cellular homeostasis and immune surveillance against transformed cells. Here, we show how CC genotype of -716 TRAIL promoter SNP rendered risk for sporadic breast cancer as compared to the CT and TT genotypes (P (recessive model) = 0.018, OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9; P (allele model) = 0.010, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.7). The in silico prediction of the introduction of core Sp1/Sp3-binding motif suggested the functional significance of the SNP variation. This functional implication was validated by luciferase assay in HeLa (P = 0.026), MCF-7 (P = 0.022), HepG2 (P = 0.024), and HT1080 (P = 0.030) cells and also by real-time expression studies on tumor tissues (P = 0.01), revealing the transcriptionally repressed status of -716 T when compared to -716 C allele. The SNP-SNP interactions reflected an enhanced protective effect of CT and TT genotypes with the protective genetic backgrounds of TP53-BRCA2 (P = 0.002, OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1-0.6), IFNG (P = 0.0000002, OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.4), and common variant Casp8 (P = 0.0003, OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.7). Interestingly, a comparison with clinical parameters showed overrepresented CT and TT genotypes in progressing (P = 0.041) and ER/PR negative tumors (P = 0.024/0.006). This was explained by increased apoptotic index, calculated as a ratio of selected pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression profiles, in CC genotyped tumors, favoring either intrinsic (P = 0.008,0.018) or extrinsic (P = 0.025,0.217) pathway depending upon the ER/PR status. Our study reveals for the first time that a promoter SNP of TRAIL functionally modulates the gene and consequently its role in breast cancer pathogenesis, cautioning to consider the -716 TRAIL SNP status in patients undergoing TRAIL therapy.
  PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the decision-making process of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation who have chosen to undergo prophylactic mastectomy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, qualitative, descriptive design. SETTING: Participants were recruited from an outpatient cancer prevention center in the oncology and medical genetics departments of a large university-affiliated hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. SAMPLE: 10 women carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation; 8 previously had had a prophylactic mastectomy and 2 were scheduled for surgery at the time of study. METHODS: Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted. Field notes were written and audiotapes were transcribed verbatim. The textual data were coded and analyzed. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Decision-making process for prophylactic mastectomy. FINDINGS: Two broad findings emerged. First, several intrapersonal and contextual factors interacted throughout the process to move women either closer to choosing a prophylactic mastectomy or further from the decision. Second, all women reported experiencing a "pivotal point," an emotionally charged event when the decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy became definitive. Pivotal points for patients included either receiving a positive result for a genetic mutation or a breast cancer diagnosis for herself or a family member in the context of positive mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: Decision making about prophylactic mastectomy was an affective and intuitive process incorporating contexts and their relations rather than a rational, straight-forward process of weighing pros and cons. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Supportive interventions for women in this population should explicitly address the individual and the inter-relationships of contextual factors that shape decision making about prophylactic mastectomy while recognizing important affective components involved.
  Germ-line mutations in the tumour suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. We have recently identified a Greenlandic Inuit BRCA1 nucleotide 234T>G/c.115T>G (p.Cys39Gly) founder mutation, which at that time was the only disease-causing BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation identified in this population. Here, we describe the identification of a novel disease-causing BRCA1 nucleotide 4803delCC/c.4684delCC mutation in a Greenlandic Inuit with ovarian cancer. The mutation introduces a frameshift and a premature stop at codon 1572. We have also identified a BRCA1 nucleotide 249T>A/c.130T>A (p.Cys44Ser) mutation in another Greenlandic individual with ovarian cancer. This patient share a 1-2 Mb genomic fragment, containing the BRCA1 gene, with four Danish families harbouring the same mutation, suggesting that the 249T>A/c.130T>A (p.Cys44Ser) mutation originates from a Danish ancestor. We conclude that screening of Greenlandic Inuits with high risk of breast or ovarian cancer should include sequencing of the entire BRCA1 gene.
  Breast cancer associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations differs from non-BRCA tumors in several respects. We determined whether there was any difference in CCND1 (11q13) and ZNF217 (20q13) gene amplification with respect to BRCA status. Of 40 breast cancer samples examined, 15 and 9 were from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively, and 16 from patients without mutation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that eight tumors exhibited CCND1 amplification (20%; 3 BRCA1, 3 BRCA2, 2 non-BRCA). ZNF217 amplification was observed in three of 38 cases (8%; 2 BRCA1, 1 non-BRCA). There was no significant difference in CCND1 and ZNF217 amplification between BRCA1, BRCA2 and non-BRCA tumors. CCND1 amplification was associated with decreased disease-free (P = 0.045) and overall survival (P = 0.015). BRCA1 tumors with CCND1 amplification were estrogen receptor negative, in contrast to CCND1 amplified BRCA2 and non-BRCA tumors, suggesting that concurrent CCND1 amplification and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity may predict germline BRCA1 gene mutation. All ZNF217 amplified tumors were of the medullary histological type (P = 0.002). There was no statistical correlation between CCND1 and ZNF217 amplification and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and ERBB2 expression and TNM classification. CCND1 amplification did not correlate with EGFR expression.
  BACKGROUND: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is often recommended to carriers of deleterious breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutations in order to reduce their breast cancer risk by 50% and their ovarian cancer risk by approximately 95%. To evaluate the acceptance, timing, histopathology findings and follow-up results we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomies. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2009, 306 women who tested positive for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were counseled for preventive options. RRSO was recommended to all mutation carriers at age 40 or 5 years prior to the earliest occurrence of ovarian cancer in the family. Data from 175 BRCA mutation carriers (92 BRCA1 and 83 BRCA2), who decided to undergo a RRSO, were analyzed. Data were collected from study entry until recent follow-up. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of BRCA mutation carriers opted for RRSO. Mean age at time of surgery was 47 years. Overall, one occult carcinoma of the fallopian tube was detected at the time of surgery in a 57-year-old woman and one primary peritoneal carcinoma occurred 26 months after RRSO in a 59-year-old woman. CONCLUSION: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is widely accepted. Recommendation of surgery at the age of 40 seems to be safe and the frequency of extraovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma after surgery is low.
  The aim of this study was to verify whether histopathological features of extratumoral and of primary tumor breast tissue could play a role in identifying patients with familial characteristics. We examined the clinicopathological features of 504 patients with sporadic or familial breast cancer stratified for risk of BRCA mutation. Patients with a higher risk of being carrier of BRCA gene mutations were significantly associated with tumor poor differentiation (p=0.003), positive lymph node invasion (p=0.02) and presence of vascular peritumoral invasion (p=0.008). Among the extra-tumoral lesions, only the epithelial proliferative lesions were related to higher mutation risk both in the overall series and familial patients (p<0.0001 and p=0.003, respectively). Interestingly, a significant difference in terms of high mutation risk was observed in usual ductal hyperplasia lesions (UDH), (p=0.002). We suggest that vascular peritumoral invasion and UDH lesions could predict a higher mutation risk of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and help in individuating patient candidates to further molecular analysis.
  Women who are at high risk of breast cancer can be offered more intensive surveillance or prophylactic measures, such as surgery or chemoprevention. Central to decisions regarding the level of prevention is accurate and individualized risk assessment. This review aims to distill the diverse literature and provide practicing clinicians with an overview of the available risk assessment methods. Risk assessments fall into two groups: the risk of carrying a mutation in a high-risk gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 and the risk of developing breast cancer with or without such a mutation. Knowledge of breast cancer risks, taken together with the risks and benefits of the intervention, is needed to choose an appropriate disease management strategy. A number of models have been developed for assessing these risks, but independent validation of such models has produced variable results. Some models are able to predict both mutation carriage risks and breast cancer risk; however, to date, all are limited by only moderate discriminatory accuracy. Further improvements in the knowledge of how to best integrate both new risk factors and newly discovered genetic variants into these models will allow clinicians to more accurately determine which women are most likely to develop breast cancer. These steady and incremental improvements in models will need to undergo revalidation.
  Disparities in clinical outcomes of breast cancer have been described among different racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. Convincing data exist showing that Latina women have a lower incidence of breast cancer but a higher breast cancer-related mortality rate compared with white women. Noticeable differences in breast cancer incidence are present even within different Latina subsets with a higher incidence in second- and third-generation women compared with foreign born. An increasing amount of data exists pointing to significant differences in the genetics and biology of breast cancer in Latinas as a significant contributor to the higher mortality, including a higher incidence of triple-negative breast cancers (which do not overexpress HER-2 protein and are negative for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors). Other social and environmental factors are likely to play a significant role as well, including a lower rate of screening mammography, variable access to medical care, among others. Recent data are inconclusive regarding differences among racial/ethnic groups in the response to chemotherapy. Data on racial/ethnic variations in the pharmacogenomics of chemotherapy, endocrine treatments, and toxicity are more limited, with some data suggesting differences in frequencies of polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of some of these agents. Further studies are needed on this subject.
  Genetic testing for inherited susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer can be compared with similar testing for colorectal cancer as a "natural experiment." Inherited susceptibility accounts for a similar fraction of both cancers and genetic testing results guide decisions about options for prophylactic surgery in both sets of conditions. One major difference is that in the United States, Myriad Genetics is the sole provider of genetic testing, because it has sole control of relevant patents for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, whereas genetic testing for familial colorectal cancer is available from multiple laboratories. Colorectal cancer-associated genes are also patented, but they have been nonexclusively licensed. Prices for BRCA1 and 2 testing do not reflect an obvious price premium attributable to exclusive patent rights compared with colorectal cancer testing, and indeed, Myriad's per unit costs are somewhat lower for BRCA1/2 testing than testing for colorectal cancer susceptibility. Myriad has not enforced patents against basic research and negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Cancer Institute in 1999 for institutional BRCA testing in clinical research. The main impact of patenting and licensing in BRCA compared with colorectal cancer is the business model of genetic testing, with a sole provider for BRCA and multiple laboratories for colorectal cancer genetic testing. Myriad's sole-provider model has not worked in jurisdictions outside the United States, largely because of differences in breadth of patent protection, responses of government health services, and difficulty in patent enforcement.
  PURPOSE: Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) is known to regulate genomic instability and tumorigenesis in multiple human cancers. The underlying mechanism, however, is not fully understood. We examined the molecular mechanism of Aurora-A regulation in human ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Retrovirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence the expression of Aurora-A in the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, OVCA432, and OVCA433. Immunofluorescence, Western blotting, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, and animal assay were used to test centrosome amplification, cell cycle alteration, apoptosis, DNA damage response, tumor growth, and genomic instability. Immunostaining of BRCA2 and Aurora-A was done in ovarian, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer samples. RESULTS: Knockdown of Aurora-A reduced centrosome amplification, malformation of mitotic spindles, and chromosome aberration, leading to decreased tumor growth. Silencing Aurora-A attenuated cell cycle progression and enhanced apoptosis and DNA damage response by restoring p21, pRb, and BRCA2 expression. Aurora-A was inversely correlated with BRCA2 in high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, positive expression of BRCA2 predicted increased overall and disease-free survival, whereas positive expression of Aurora-A predicted poor overall and disease-free survival (P < 0.05). Moreover, an increased Aurora-A to BRCA2 expression ratio predicted poor overall survival (P = 0.047) compared with a decreased Aurora-A to BRCA2 expression ratio. CONCLUSION: Aurora-A regulates genomic instability and tumorigenesis through cell cycle dysregulation and BRCA2 suppression. The negative correlation between Aurora-A and BRCA2 exists in multiple cancers, whereas the expression ratio of Aurora-A to BRCA2 predicts ovarian cancer patient outcome.
  PURPOSE: Carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations are at high lifetime risk of breast cancer (BC); however, the BC onset broadly vary in individual patients. Recently, polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat length polymorphism of the amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) gene was analyzed as a risk factor influencing BC onset in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with contradictory results. METHODS: We genotyped AIB1 poly-Q repeat in 243 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, 61 patients with familial BC (negatively tested for the presence of BRCA1/2 mutation), 221 patients with sporadic BC, and 176 non-cancer controls using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and statistically evaluated the effect of AIB1 poly-Q repeat length polymorphism on BC onset. RESULTS: Having used previously published statistical analyses of AIB1 poly-Q repeat length (>/=28 and >/=29 repeat cutpoints or analysis of AIB1 poly-Q repeat length as continuous variable), we did not find any association between AIB1 poly-Q repeat length and BC development in analyzed BC groups. However, the analysis of individual genotypes revealed that AIB1 genotype consisting of 28/28 glutamine repeats served as a protective factor in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.41-0.99; P = 0.045) and as a risk factor in carriers of mutation in exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene (HR = 3.50; 95% CI 1.25-9.78; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that AIB1 poly-Q repeat length polymorphism does not influence the BC risk in general but suggest that the specific AIB1 genotypes should be considered in patients with BC carrying mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes.
  Elastofibroma is a rare, benign fibrous proliferation that most commonly occur in periscapular soft tissues and is characterized by accumulated elastic fibers. Although the lesion is generally regarded as a reactive process, an unusual fibroblastic pseudotumor or as a fibroelastic tumor-like lesion, its etiology remains unknown. Cytogenetic studies in these lesions detected chromosomal instability and some recurrent clonal chromosomal changes, which raised the possibility that the lesion represents a neoplastic process. Here, we report the genomic alterations detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in two cases of elastofibroma. Both cases showed losses on 1p, 13q, 19p, and 22q by aCGH. In addition, deletion of CASR (3q21), GSTP1 (11q13), BRCA2 (13q12) and gains on APC (5q21) and PAH (12q23) were observed by MLPA in both samples. Genomic screening studies of this fibrous proliferation may lead to identify chromosomal regions containing genes involved in the development of elastofibromas.
  p53 maintains genome integrity either by regulating the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair or by interacting with partner proteins. Here we provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between the tumor suppressors p53 and BRCA2. We found that the transactivation domain of p53 made specific interactions with the C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding-fold domains of BRCA2 (BRCA2(CTD)). A second distinct site situated on the p53 DNA-binding domain, bound to a region containing BRC repeats of BRCA2 (BRCA2([BRC1-8])) and may contribute synergistically for high affinity association of intact full-length proteins. Overexpression of BRCA2 and BRCA2(CTD) suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53 with a concomitant reduction in the expression of p53-target genes such as Bax and p21. Consequently, p53-mediated apoptosis was significantly attenuated by BRCA2. The observed physical association of p53 and BRCA2 may have important functional implications in the p53 transactivation-independent suppression of homologous recombination and suggests a possible interregulatory role for both proteins in apoptosis and DNA repair.
  Here we report the fabrication of a 3-pixel electrochemical DNA sensor array via potential-assisted "click" chemistry. We found that the sensors in the array exhibit close to identical sensor performance when compared to sensors constructed via conventional "click" chemistry.
  Recent studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that significantly modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Since these risk modifiers were originally identified as genetic risk factors for breast cancer in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), additional risk modifiers for BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be identified from promising signals discovered in breast cancer GWAS. A total of 350 SNPs identified as candidate breast cancer risk factors (P < 1 x 10(-3)) in two breast cancer GWAS studies were genotyped in 3451 BRCA1 and 2006 BRCA2 mutation carriers from nine centers. Associations with breast cancer risk were assessed using Cox models weighted for penetrance. Eight SNPs in BRCA1 carriers and 12 SNPs in BRCA2 carriers, representing an enrichment over the number expected, were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (P(trend) < 0.01). The minor alleles of rs6138178 in SNRPB and rs6602595 in CAMK1D displayed the strongest associations in BRCA1 carriers (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.90, P(trend) = 3.6 x 10(-4) and HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41, P(trend) = 4.2 x 10(-4)), whereas rs9393597 in LOC134997 and rs12652447 in FBXL7 showed the strongest associations in BRCA2 carriers (HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.25-1.92, P(trend) = 6 x 10(-5) and HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.16-1.62, P(trend) = 1.7 x 10(-4)). The magnitude and direction of the associations were consistent with the original GWAS. In subsequent risk assessment studies, the loci appeared to interact multiplicatively for breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Promising candidate SNPs from GWAS were identified as modifiers of breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Upon further validation, these SNPs together with other genetic and environmental factors may improve breast cancer risk assessment in these populations.
  Slater EP, Langer P, Niemczyk E, Strauch K, Butler J, Habbe N, Neoptolemos JP, Greenhalf W, Bartsch DK. PALB2 mutations in European pancreatic cancer families. Recently, PALB2 was reported to be a new pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene as determined by exomic sequencing, as truncating PALB2 mutations were identified in 3 of 96 American patients with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC). Representing the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) and the German National Case Collection for Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FaPaCa), we evaluated whether truncating mutations could also be detected in European FPC families. We have directly sequenced the 13 exons of the PALB2 gene in affected index patients of 81 FPC families. An index patient was defined as the first medically identified patient, stimulating investigation of other members of the family to discover a possible genetic factor. None of these patients carried a BRCA2 mutation. We identified three (3.7%) truncating PALB2 mutations, each producing different stop codons: R414X, 508-9delAG and 3116delA. Interestingly, each of these three families also had a history of breast cancer. Therefore, PALB2 mutations might be causative for FPC in a small subset of European families, especially in those with an additional occurrence of breast cancer.
  Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, but also of developing second primary breast cancer. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast cancer must choose between breast conservation (BCT) and mastectomy (M) yet data on outcomes are limited. The purpose of this study is to compare long-term outcome following BCT and M in BRCA1/2 carriers. 655 women with BRCA1/2 mutations diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with BCT (n = 302) or M (n = 353) were identified and underwent follow-up to assess local, regional, and systemic recurrence. Local failure as first failure was significantly more likely in those treated with BCT compared to M, with a cumulative estimated risk of 23.5 vs. 5.5%, respectively, at 15 years (P < 0.0001); 15-year estimates in carriers treated with BCT and chemotherapy was 11.9% (P = 0.08 when compared to M). Most events appeared to be second primary cancers rather than failure to control the primary tumor. The risk of contralateral breast cancer was high in all groups, exceeding 40%, but was not statistically significantly different by use of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or not, suggesting no added risk from scatter RT at 10 and 15 years. There were no differences seen in regional or systemic recurrences between the BCT and M groups, and no difference in overall survival. In conclusion, BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast cancer have similar survival whether treated with M or BCT. However, women undergoing BCT have an elevated risk of a second in-breast event that is significantly reduced in the presence of chemotherapy. Contralateral breast cancer events are very common.
  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of genetic counseling referral for ovarian cancer patients who are at substantial risk for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. METHODS: An analysis was performed of new ovarian cancer patients who were seen at a comprehensive cancer center from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2007. Patients at substantial (more than 20-25%) risk for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified and records reviewed for referral to genetic counseling. Time to referral was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 3,765 epithelial ovarian cancer patients were seen during the 9-year period. On average, 23.8% of patients met substantial-risk criteria for BRCA mutations. In 1999, only 12% of patients at substantial-risk were referred. Referral improved over time with 48% referred in 2007 (P<.001). Newly diagnosed patients were more often referred for genetic counseling than new patients with recurrent disease or those seen as second opinions. African-American women meeting substantial-risk criteria were less likely to be referred than were white or Hispanic women (P=.009). CONCLUSION: Although dictated family history was accurate, interpretation of risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and subsequent referral to genetic counseling was poor. Although there was significant improvement over time, 50% of substantial-risk patients still were missed. Systematic efforts to identify those ovarian cancer patients at substantial risk for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 are necessary.
  OBJECTIVE: Women with a BRCA1/2 mutation or members of a hereditary breast ovarian cancer family (HBOC) have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. The only effective strategy to reduce this risk is a risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term surgical outcome and safety of a RRSO. PATIENT AND METHODS: Included were all consecutive women with a BRCA1/2 mutation or members of a HBOC family who visited our Family Cancer Clinic between September 1995 and March 2006, and choose for RRSO. RESULTS: 159 women were included, of which 97 (61.0%) BRCA1 and 32 (20.1%) BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 30 women of a HBOC family (18.9%). The median age at RRSO was 42.9 years (30.3-61.1) in the BRCA1 group, 48.4 years (33.5-66.9) in the BRCA 2 group and 46.4 (32.8-68.7) years in the HBOC group (p=0.02). The median body mass index (BMI) was 24.9 kg/m(2), 30.1% were overweighed (BMI 25-30) and 18.7% were obese (BMI>30). The RRSO was performed by primary laparoscopy (n=154) or laparotomy (n=5). Intraoperatively, one (0.6%) major complication occurred and laparoscopy was converted to laparotomy. In one patient (0.6%) a minor complication occurred. Post-operatively five minor complications (3.1%) were observed. Median hospital stay was 1 day (0-13 days). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers seems to be a safe procedure with a low intraoperative and post-operative complication rate (1.3% and 3.1% respectively), a low conversion rate (0.6%) and a short median hospital stay (1.0 day).
  A 42-year-old woman presented with localized irritation, erythema and sharp pain in the one breast. After unsuccessful treatment for mastitis, an oncology consultation was obtained. A breast biopsy revealed an invasive carcinoma and a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer was made. The patient was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently underwent bilateral mastectomy. A total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was also performed at the same time due to the presence of a pelvic mass. Morphologic and immunohistochemical examination of the specimens helped to clarify the correct diagnosis of primary ovarian carcinoma with widespread metastases to bilateral breasts.
  PURPOSE: To compare the frequency of visceral relapse of BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancer to that of nonhereditary controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed in Scotland with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation were identified. Those with previous malignancy were excluded. Each remaining patient who experienced relapse was matched with two nonhereditary controls. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients with EOC/PPC and germline BRCA1/2 mutations were identified. Fifteen had inadequate clinical data, two had carcinosarcoma, 27 had previous breast cancer, and 16 were in remission. Of the remaining 19 patients who were BRCA1/2 deficient, 14 patients (74%) developed visceral metastases compared with six (16%) of 38 patients in the control group. The percentages of liver, lung, and splenic metastases were 53%, 32%, and 32%, respectively, in the patients compared with 5%, 3%, and 5%, respectively, in the controls. When events occurring outside the matched follow-up period were omitted, the percentages of visceral, liver, lung, and splenic metastases were 58%, 42%, 16%, and 32% in the patients compared with 5%, 0%, 0%, and 3% in controls (P < .001, P < .001, P = .066, and P = .011, respectively). In an independent validation set, the corresponding percentages of visceral, liver, lung, and splenic metastases were 63%, 46%, 13%, and 17% in the patients compared with 11%, 4%, 2%, and 2% in controls (P < .001, P < .001, P = .153, and P = .052, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although sporadic EOC commonly remains confined to the peritoneum, BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancer frequently metastasizes to viscera. These data extend the ovarian BRCAness phenotype, imply BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancer is biologically distinct, and suggest that patients with visceral metastases should be considered for BRCA1/2 sequencing.
  PURPOSE: Selective tumor cell cytotoxicity can be achieved through a synthetic lethal strategy using poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in whom tumor cells have defective homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Platinum-based chemotherapy responses correlate with HR DNA repair capacity. Olaparib is a potent, oral PARP inhibitor that is well tolerated, with antitumor activity in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer were treated with olaparib within a dose-escalation and single-stage expansion of a phase I trial. Antitumor activity was subsequently correlated with platinum sensitivity. RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated: 48 had germline BRCA1/2 mutations; one had a BRCA2 germline sequence change of unknown significance, and another had a strong family history of BRCA1/2-associated cancers who declined mutation testing. Of the 50 patients, 13 had platinum-sensitive disease, 24 had platinum-resistant disease, and 13 had platinum-refractory disease (according to platinum-free interval). Twenty (40%; 95% CI, 26% to 55%) achieved Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) complete or partial responses and/or tumor marker (CA125) responses, and three (6.0%) maintained RECIST disease stabilization for more than 4 months, giving an overall clinical benefit rate of 46% (95% CI, 32% to 61%). Median response duration was 28 weeks. There was a significant association between the clinical benefit rate and platinum-free interval across the platinum-sensitive, resistant, and refractory subgroups (69%, 45%, and 23%, respectively). Post hoc analyses indicated associations between platinum sensitivity and extent of olaparib response (radiologic change, P = .001; CA125 change, P = .002). CONCLUSION: Olaparib has antitumor activity in BRCA1/2 mutation ovarian cancer, which is associated with platinum sensitivity.
  The enzyme poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) plays an important role in the repair of DNA damage via a mechanism called base excision repair (BER). Initially, inhibition of PARP-1 showed to be a promising anti-tumor strategy in preclinical models using BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient tumor cell lines. More recently, several small molecules targeting PARP-1 entered the clinic and demonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity in patients with BRCA deficient breast and ovarian cancers, and in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. In this review we aim to summarize the most recent advances in the development of PARP inhibitors, with a focus on the clinical data.
  In the past few years, ovarian cancer research has focused increasingly on disease prevention; but an increasing number of women refer to gynecology and clinical genetics clinics with a family history of ovarian cancer and inherited familial mutations. The interest on the issue has increased also due to the identification of BReast CAncer1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes mutations. The importance of recognizing the characteristics of hereditary ovarian cancer (HOC) and manage women at risk appropriately will provide more accurate care of the high-risk population. Women at risk can be identified by pedigree analysis and may receive counseling from interdisciplinary cancer genetics clinics, while those at high risk need to receive genetic testing. Risk calculation programs define risks and assist in decision-making in clinical options and genetic testing; they provide information on the risks of the disease, mutation status, and the use of genetic testing in the management of high-risk families. Furthermore, while a large number of surrogate preliminary markers have been identified, there are still limited studies on ovarian cancer genomics. Different options for risk management of HOC are available: surveillance, chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery. Surveillance in HOC high-risk patients is still not accurate. Chemoprevention is currently a controversial topic, because a number of major issues still need to be addressed in developing and testing agents for ovarian cancer chemoprevention. Prophylactic surgery has been shown to effectively decrease cancer risk, and it has the possibility to substantially reduce ovarian cancer mortality.
  RAD51 is a key factor in homologous recombination (HR) and plays an essential role in cellular proliferation by repairing DNA damage during replication. The assembly of RAD51 at DNA damage is strictly controlled by RAD51 mediators, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. We found that human RAD51 directly binds GEMIN2/SIP1, a protein involved in spliceosome biogenesis. Biochemical analyses indicated that GEMIN2 enhances the RAD51-DNA complex formation by inhibiting RAD51 dissociation from DNA, and thereby stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous pairing. GEMIN2 also enhanced the RAD51-mediated strand exchange, when RPA was pre-bound to ssDNA before the addition of RAD51. To analyze the function of GEMIN2, we depleted GEMIN2 in the chicken DT40 line and in human cells. The loss of GEMIN2 reduced HR efficiency and resulted in a significant decrease in the number of RAD51 subnuclear foci, as observed in cells deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2. These observations and our biochemical analyses reveal that GEMIN2 regulates HR as a novel RAD51 mediator.
  PURPOSE: BLID is a BH3-like motif containing apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of BLID-induced apoptosis and to assess the significance of BLID expression in breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The interaction between BLID and Bcl-X(L) was examined using in vitro transcription/translation, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunoflourescence assays. The relationship between BLID mRNA expression and pathologic measures in breast cancer specimens (n = 55) was examined using the publicly available ONCOMINE microarray database. Immunohistochemistry was done using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 148 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinomas (IDC) and 58 cases of invasive lobular breast carcinomas, and breast tissue microarrays representing additional 437 cases (>85% IDC) with associated clinicopathologic database and long-term clinical follow-up (median 7 years). RESULTS: BLID was found to interact with Bcl-X(L), and the binding was enhanced in cancer cells exposed to doxorubicin or cisplatin. Exogenous expression of BLID correlated with activation of Bax and an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c. BLID mRNA expression was significantly reduced in grade 3 relative to grade 1 and 2 breast cancer (P = 0.023). Cytoplasmic BLID immunoreactivity was absent in IDC compared with invasive lobular breast carcinoma (P < 0.001). Lack of BLID expression was associated with younger age (median 40 years), African American ethnicity, tumor size, and triple-negative breast cancer (estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; all P < 0.005). Significant correlations were observed between BLID negativity and declines in overall, cause-specific, and local relapse-free survival (all P < 0.03). Multivariate analysis indicated that BLID is an independent prognostic factor of distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.302; 95% confidence interval, 0.160-0.570, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: BLID is a new binding partner of Bcl-X(L) and a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, familial mutations in which account for approximately 5% of breast cancer cases in the USA annually. Germ line mutations in BRCA1 that truncate or inactivate the protein lead to a cumulative risk of breast cancer, by age 70, of up to 80%, whereas the risk of ovarian cancer is 30-40%. For germ line BRCA2 mutations, the breast cancer cumulative risk approaches 50%, whereas for ovarian cancers, it is between 10 and 15%. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintaining genome integrity at least in part by engaging in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control and even the regulation of key mitotic or cell division steps. Unsurprisingly, the complete loss of function of either protein leads to a dramatic increase in genomic instability. How they function in maintaining genome integrity after the onset of DNA damage will be the focus of this review.
  Multiple lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors modify the cancer risks in carriers of mutations in Mendelian cancer syndromes. We review the latest evidence for genetic modifiers of risk for four Mendelian cancer syndromes. In general, candidate gene studies have not been very successful at identifying modifier genes and most studies have been underpowered, but recently polymorphisms identified through genome wide association studies of unselected cancer patients and controls have been shown to modify cancer risk in studies of large numbers of mutation carriers. This approach has identified two genetic variants that are associated with colorectal cancer risk in Lynch Syndrome, and five polymorphisms that are associated with the risk of breast cancer for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carriers. As predicted from the association between these five polymorphisms and risk of estrogen-positive or estrogen-negative breast cancer in the general population, differential associations of these polymorphisms with breast cancer risk were found for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers presumably because BRCA1 breast cancer tumors are predominantly ER-negative and are biologically distinct from BRCA2 breast cancers. These findings suggest that studies of mutation carriers may be useful for identifying genetic variants associated with different disease subtypes. The current literature underlies the need for increased international collaboration between individual studies, and the continued recruitment of mutation carriers, in order to reliably estimate and identify the genetic modifiers of risk in Mendelian cancer syndromes.
  Risk assessment evaluation and breast cancer (BRCA) testing can occur in situations where a woman considers herself to be at increased risk for developing breast cancer or her physicians, either during routine evaluation or after diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer, consider her to be at risk for harboring a genetic predisposition to breast malignancy. This study examined the impact of risk assessment counseling on trends in breast surgery and cost of care. A retrospective chart review was performed from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008 for women older than 18 years who underwent breast surgery for malignancy or prophylaxis, had at least 1-year follow-up, and underwent genetic counseling. From the total number of women treated at our institution who underwent unilateral or bilateral mastectomy, we identified 102 women who underwent genetic counseling and selected 199 patients who did not undergo counseling to create a 4:1 retrospective case-control study. Patients who underwent BRCA gene testing and/or counseling were compared with patients who did not (controls). The study was powered at 70%, and alpha was set at 0.05. Counseled patients were >9 times more likely to undergo bilateral mastectomies (odds ratio = 9.18). They were younger (46.4 vs. 61.8) and incurred higher total costs ($10,810 vs. $7,266) (P < 0.002). The same trend was observed in each group. In counseled and control groups, younger women chose bilateral mastectomies (mean 44.4; 55.5), whereas older women chose unilateral procedures (mean 49.8; 63.02) (P < 0.014). Total cost for bilateral mastectomies was greater than unilateral mastectomies for both groups. Of 55 counseled patients undergoing mastectomies (85 breasts), 78 (92%) breasts were reconstructed, whereas 113 (49%) of 230 breasts were reconstructed in the control group. There was a statistically significant association between counseling with BRCA testing and decision to undergo bilateral as opposed to unilateral mastectomies. Younger women were also more likely to choose bilateral mastectomies whether or not they underwent counseling. Furthermore, a greater proportion of counseled women who underwent reconstruction opted to have bilateral implants. At our institution, younger women tend to choose costlier options.
  The aim of this study was to examine the negative predictive value for a panel of serum markers in women at high risk for developing ovarian cancer. A total of 201 serum samples were collected and analyzed from 102 women at "high risk" for ovarian cancer: 26 with primary ovarian cancer, 31 with recurrent ovarian cancer, 28 with benign gynecologic diseases, and 14 with other cancers. Samples were tested for cancer antigen (CA) 125 II, CA19-9, CA72-4, CA15-3, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, OVX1, and the marker values were further used as input to be evaluated by a previously trained artificial neural network (ANN). CA125 alone identified 72% of the primary ovarian cancers at a specificity of 95%. If either CA125 or CA72-4 were elevated, sensitivity rose to 80%. Adding macrophage colony-stimulating factor-improved sensitivity to 84% and when CA15-3 was included, a sensitivity of 88% was achieved. Specificity of the four marker panel was, however, reduced to 82.5%. By contrast, at the same sensitivity of 88%, the ANN exhibited a much higher specificity at 92.5% (p = 0.0105). Our data suggest that the combined use of multiple biomarkers improve sensitivity in women at high risk for ovarian cancer. In contrast to the simple "or" combination rule, the ANN was able to achieve a higher sensitivity without significant loss in specificity.
  DNA-repair mechanisms play an important role in the maintenance of DNA integrity and protection against DNA damage. Deregulation of these mechanisms is associated with the development of cancer as is seen in breast tumours with mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2. Recent biologic findings suggest that in tumours in which one DNA repair pathway is deficient, concomitant inhibition of other repair pathways could have potential synergistic activity. Pharmacological inhibition of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a key element of the base excision repair pathway, can have synthetic lethality in tumours with deficient homologous recombination. These findings have paved the way for the clinical development of PARP inhibitors in breast tumours especially in patients with germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, a population known to have deficient homologous recombination. Patients with sporadic breast cancer, especially those with a basal-like profile may also develop cancer which is deficient in DNA repair and may be susceptible to PARP inhibition. In this review we will update the clinical and biological data underlying the development of drugs targeting DNA repair with a focus on breast cancer.
  Identification of mutations in the BRCA2 gene and estimation of their clinical consequences for women and men treated in the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center Warsaw, Poland in the years 1998-2008. The probands (97 women and 8 men) had a family history of breast and ovarian cancer (median age 46). The presence of molecular changes was examined in DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Germline mutations in 27 exons of the BRCA2 gene were screened by 'touchdown' PCR amplification, DHPLC and sequencing. Missense mutations were classified by multiple-sequences alignments of orthologous BRCA2 protein sequences with T-Coffee software. 39 molecular changes (8 novel) were identified in the BRCA2 gene in 105 investigated patients. In 12 patients the following pathogenic mutations were identified: 5467insT, 6174delT, 6192delAT, 6675delTA, 8141del5, 9152delT, 9326insA, 9631delC, IVS23-2A > G and E394X. The presence of 10 missense type mutations was detected including the following: D1420O, T1915 M, N3124I. The determination of pathogenic status of molecular variants detected in BRCA2 gene, described in the BIC mutation database as 'UV' depends on many parameters. Important is the assessment of the evolutionary conservation of their protein sequences and studying of the frequency of molecular variants detected in breast cancer patients and in population. A high diversity was found of the pathogenic mutations detected in BRCA2 gene in the Polish population.
  BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the Estonian population. We analyzed genetic data and questionnaire from 64 early-onset (< 45 y) breast cancer patients, 47 familial cases (patients with breast or ovarian cancer and a case of these cancers in the family), and 33 predictive cases (patients without breast or ovarian cancer, with a family history of such diseases) from Estonia for mutations in the BRCA1 gene. A sub-set of familial cases and predictive cases were also analyzed for mutations in the BRCA2 gene. METHODS: For mutation detection, we used the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Single Stranded Conformation Polymorphism Heteroduplex Analysis (PCR-SSCP-HD), followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: We identified three clinically important mutations in the BRCA1 gene, including seven occurrences of the c.5382insC mutation, three of c.4154delA, and one instance of c.3881_3882delGA. We also detected six polymorphisms: c.2430T>C, c.3232A>G, c.4158A>G, c.4427T>C, c.4956A>G, and c.5002T>C. Four sequence alterations were detected in introns: c.560+64delT, c.560+ [36-38delCTT, 52-63del12], c.666-58delT, and c.5396+60insGTATTCCACTCC. In the BRCA2 gene, two clinically important mutations were found: c.9610C>T and c.6631delTTAAATG. Additionally, two alterations (c.7049G>T and c.7069+80delTTAG) with unknown clinical significance were detected. CONCLUSIONS: In our dataset, the overall frequency of clinically important BRCA1 mutations in early-onset patients, familial cases, and predictive testing was 7.6% (144 cases, 11 mutation carriers). Pathogenic mutations were identified in 4 of the 64 early-onset breast cancer cases (6.3%). In familial cases, clinically important mutations in the BRCA1 gene were found in 6 of the 47 individuals analyzed (12.8%). In predictive cases, 1 clinically important mutation was detected in 33 individuals studied (3%). The occurrence of clinically important mutations in BRCA2 in familial cases of breast cancer was 2 of the 16 individuals analyzed (12.5%).
  AIMS: In screening studies of women with BRCA mutations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plus mammography has >90% sensitivity for detecting breast cancer, with negligible benefit from the addition of breast self-examination (BSE) or clinical breast examination (CBE). Yet CBE is still frequently recommended, and BSE is encouraged for these women. We sought to determine the attitudes of high-risk women toward CBE and BSE. METHODS: Between November 2005 and May 2006, 137 women with BRCA mutations participating in a screening study consisting of annual MRI and mammography plus semiannual CBE were asked to complete a mailed Likert-type questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 94 (67%) respondents, mean age 47 (range 28-67), 94% strongly agreed or agreed that CBE was an important way to detect breast cancer, and almost all believed it provided an important connection to the healthcare team. Only 10% said it increased anxiety. Of the 71 (77%) who performed BSE at least occasionally, 53 thought that regular BSE gave them a sense of control over their own health. Of the 21(23%) who did not practice BSE at all, only 3 did not believe that BSE was helpful, and it made 9 more worried about breast cancer CONCLUSIONS: Although CBE adds little to cancer detection rates in women with BRCA mutations screened with MRI, the majority of these women considered CBE to be reassuring and an important means of connecting with the healthcare team. Compliance with BSE was only moderate, but it gave a significant proportion of women a greater sense of control.
  Mammalian cells are frequently at risk of DNA damage from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Accordingly, cells have evolved the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways to monitor and assure the integrity of their genome. In cells, the intact and effective DDR is essential for the maintenance of genomic stability and it acts as a critical barrier to suppress the development of cancer in humans. Two central kinases for the DDR pathway are ATM and ATR, which can phosphorylate and activate many downstream proteins for cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis if the damages are irreparable. In the last several years, we and others have made significant progress to this field by identifying BRIT1 (also known as MCPH1) as a novel key regulator in the DDR pathway. BRIT1 protein contains 3 breast cancer carboxyl terminal (BRCT) domains which are conserved in BRCA1, MDC1, 53BP1, and other important molecules involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor suppression. Our in vitro studies revealed BRIT1 to be a chromatinbinding protein required for recruitment of many important DDR proteins (ATM, MDC1, NBS1, RAD51, BRCA2) to the DNA damage sites. We recently also generated the BRIT1 knockout mice and demonstrated its essential roles in homologous recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability in vivo. In humans, BRIT1 is located on chromosome 8p23.1, where loss of hetero-zigosity is very common in many types of cancer. In this review, we will summarize the novel roles of BRIT1 in DDR, describe the relationship of BRIT1 deficiency with cancer development, and also discuss the use of synthetic lethality approach to target cancers with HR defects due to BRIT1 deficiency.
  Reports of BRCA genetic mutations and risk of death or recurrence are inconsistent. This study aimed to compare overall and disease-free breast cancer survival rates between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers for short-term and long-term outcomes separately. We searched the PUBMED and EMBASE databases and retrieved 452 articles using keywords that included breast cancer, BRCA mutation, and survival. Seventeen articles were selected for systematic review and among them 11 were included in our meta-analysis. We used the random-effects model to calculate the summary hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval. BRCA1 mutation carriers had significantly lower short-term and long-term overall survival rates (OSR) relative to non-carriers (HR = 1.92 [95% CI = 1.45-2.53]; 1.33 [1.12-1.58], respectively), while both short-term and long-term OSR of BRCA2 carriers did not differ from non-carriers (HR = 1.30 [95% CI = 0.95-1.76]; 1.12 [95% CI = 0.86-1.45], respectively). For short-term progression-free survival rate (PFSR), BRCA1 mutation carriers had a significantly lower rate than non-carriers (HR = 1.54 [95% CI = 1.12-2.12]), while BRCA2 mutation carriers had a similar PFSR (HR = 1.23 [95% CI = 0.96-1.58]). For long-term PFSRs, we found no significant results. Our results suggest that BRCA1 mutation decreases short-term and long-term OSRs and short-term PFSR, however, BRCA2 mutation does not affect either short-term or long-term survival rate, which is attributed to the different carcinogenic pathways for BRCA1 and BRCA2.

  Double heterozygosity (DH) for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is a very rare finding, particularly in non-Ashkenazi individuals, and only a few cases have been reported to date. In addition, little is known on the pathological features of the tumors that occur in DH cases and on their family history of cancer. Four carriers of pathogenic mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified among women who underwent genetic counseling for hereditary susceptibility to breast and ovarian carcinoma at three different Italian institutions. Clinical, pathological, and family history data were collected from medical records and during genetic counseling sessions. All identified DH cases developed breast carcinoma and three of them were also diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma. Mean ages of breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis were 42.7 and 48.6 years, respectively. The majority of breast cancers showed a BRCA1-related phenotype, being negative for hormone receptors and HER2. Two cases reported different gastrointestinal tumors among relatives. Although the individuals described in this study show more severe clinical features in comparison to previously reported BRCA1 and BRCA2 DH cases, our observations support the hypothesis of a non specific phenotype of DH cases in terms of age of disease onset. In addition, our observations indicate that in DH patients breast carcinogenesis appears to be driven mainly by the mutations in BRCA1. The possible association of DH for BRCA gene mutations with gastrointestinal tumors is in keeping with previous reports, but needs to be confirmed by further analyses.
  PURPOSE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors selectively target homologous recombination (HR)-defective cells and show good clinical activity in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. A high proportion (up to 50%) of sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) could be deficient in HR due to genetic or epigenetic inactivation of BRCA1/BRCA2 or other HR genes. Therefore, there is a potential for extending the use of PARP inhibitors to these patients if HR status can be identified. We developed a functional assay of HR status in primary cultures of EOCs based on Rad51 focus formation that correlates well with sensitivity to the potent PARP inhibitor AG014699. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary cultures were derived from ascitic fluid from patients with EOCs. HR status was investigated by gammaH2AX and Rad51 focus formation by immunofluorescence. Cytotoxicity to PARP inhibitors was tested by sulforhodamine B and survival assay. RESULTS: Twenty-five cultures were evaluated for HR status and cytotoxicity to PARP inhibitor. Following exposure to AG014699, there was an increase in Rad51 foci (HR competent) in 9 of 24 (36%) but no increase (HR deficient) in 16 of 24 (64%) cultures. Cytotoxicity was observed in 15 of 16 (93%) HR-deficient samples but not in 9 of 9 HR-competent samples following 24-hour exposure to 10 mumol/L AG014699. CONCLUSION: HR status can be determined in primary cancer samples by Rad51 focus formation, and this correlates with in vitro response to PARP inhibition. Use of this assay as a biomarker now needs testing in the setting of a clinical trial.
  Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer but the incomplete penetrance of these mutations suggests that other genetic and/or environmental factors may modify this risk. We present a family where all affected members carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the index case had suffered from cancer twice in the last 27 years, whereas her monozygotic twin sister, also a carrier of the mutation, remained healthy. As copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to phenotypic diversity, a comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH) was performed to see whether the differences in the CNV profile were a modifier factor of the phenotype in our monozygotic twins. Our results show that differences in the CNVs profile were not the cause of the extremely variable penetrance observed in our MZ twin. The search for an explanation should not therefore be limited to genetic changes at the level of the DNA sequence.
  PURPOSE: Women with breast cancer diagnosed early in life comprise a substantial portion of those tested for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations; however, little information is available on the subsequent risks of contralateral breast cancer in mutation carriers. This study assessed the risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer associated with carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this nested case-control study, patients with contralateral breast cancer diagnosed 1 year or more after a first primary breast cancer (n = 705) and controls with unilateral breast cancer (n = 1,398) were ascertained from an underlying population-based cohort of 52,536 women diagnosed with a first invasive breast cancer before age 55 years. Interviews and medical record reviews were used to collect risk factor and treatment histories. All women were tested for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Relative (rate ratios) and absolute (5- and 10-year cumulative) risks of developing contralateral breast cancer following a first invasive breast cancer were computed. RESULTS: Compared with noncarriers, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers had 4.5-fold (95% CI, 2.8- to 7.1-fold) and 3.4-fold (95% CI, 2.0- to 5.8-fold) increased risks of contralateral breast cancer, respectively. The relative risk of contralateral breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers increased as age of first diagnosis decreased. Age-specific cumulative risks are provided for clinical guidance. CONCLUSION: The risks of subsequent contralateral breast cancer are substantial for women who carry a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation. These findings have important clinical relevance regarding the assessment of BRCA1/BRCA2 status in patients with breast cancer and the counseling and clinical management of patients found to carry a mutation.
  Inactivation or loss of the tumour suppressor Ras associated domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) allele has been described in breast cancer. Recently, a missense polymorphism predicting p.A331S in RASSF1A was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. We genotyped p.A331S RASSF1A in 854 independent, familial, white breast cancer patients (645 BRCA mutation negative, 119 BRCA1 and 90 BRCA2 positive) and compared the genotype in 331 healthy women. The RASSF1A p.A331S variant was not more common in the familial breast cancer cases than in the controls (P = 0.27). Subset analysis demonstrated no association in the BRCA1 (P = 0.26), BRCA2 (P = 0.16) or BRCA negative (P = 0.30) samples. Hence, the RASSF1A p.A331S polymorphism is not confirmed as a significant germline contributor to familial breast cancer susceptibility.
  Breast cancer is one of the most frequent tumors in women, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes play a major role in the hereditary susceptibility for this disease. Until the age of 70 women carrying a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a 45-85% probability of developing breast cancer, and 11-62% probability of developing ovarian cancer. Mutation carrier's tumors contain nonfunctional BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which in healthy cells are involved in DNA repair. These tumors show an increased sensitivity to DNA damaging chemical agents and to PARP (poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase1) inhibitors. New targeted therapies already in use are directed toward tumors of mutation carriers. Successful treatment is most likely to be achieved through cooperation of a pathologist, oncologist and a genetic laboratory performing BRCA genes mutation screening.
  Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA2 plays a well-established role in maintaining genome stability by regulating homologous recombination. BRCA2 has more recently been implicated in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, but the molecular basis for this remains unknown. We have used time-lapse microscopy, recently developed cytokinesis assays and BAC recombineering (bacterial artificial chromosome recombinogenic engineering) to investigate the function and localization of BRCA2 during cell division. Our analysis suggests that BRCA2 does not regulate cytokinesis in human cells. Thus, cytokinesis defects are unlikely to contribute to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis in BRCA2-related cancers.
  The two major susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Early detection of mutation carriers has crucial clinical importance, as it allows identification of women who may benefit from intensive clinical follow-up or prophylactic surgery. Generally accepted inclusion criteria for BRCA1/2 mutation testing are based either upon family history of breast or ovarian cancer or young age at cancer diagnosis. In order to analyze the impact of BRCA1/2 mutations on breast cancer development in the Czech population and to confront the clinical and histopathological data of mutation carriers with current criteria for mutation testing we examined the frequency of mutations in unselected breast cancer cases. Mutational analysis of BRCA1/2 genes performed in 679 unselected female breast cancer patients included all recurrent deleterious alterations previously identified in the Prague area and truncating mutations in the whole exon 11 of BRCA1. Within analyzed gene sequences more than 80% of mutations were identified previously in high-risk patients. A total of 16 breast cancer patients (2.4%) carried a mutation. BRCA1 mutations were identified in 14 (2.1%) whereas BRCA2 in 2 (0.3%) women. Family history of ovarian cancer was a strong predictor of a BRCA1/2 mutation (OR = 8.3; p = 0.01), however, family history of breast cancer was not indicative of carrier status. A significant association between medullary breast cancer and mutation status was observed. Current criteria for BRCA1/2 mutation testing would distinguish only 6 out of 16 (37.5%) carriers identified in our study. Ten breast cancer patients with confirmed BRCA1/2 germ-line mutation exhibited no clinical characteristics that would predict their carrier status. Therefore, we believe that the testing for BRCA1/2 mutations in the Czech Republic may not be restricted only to high-risk patients. Our results indicate that analysis of locally prevalent BRCA1/2 mutations in all breast cancer patients might extend substantially the percentage of identified mutation carriers.
  We previously showed that about 80% of breast cancer patients at high risk to carry mutation in BRCA genes presented at least one polymorphism in these genes which resulted potentially harmful by in silico analysis. In the present paper, the genealogic transmission of those polymorphic coding and noncoding variants of BRCA genes in family's members has been investigated. Thirty families, enrolled within the Genetic Counselling Program of our Institute, with probands and at least one-first degree relative (n = 67 family members) available, have been studied for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathological mutation and polymorphic variants' transmission. Ten and 6 probands carried Mendelian transmitted mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Polymorphic coding and noncoding variants were transmitted in each family's relatives with a frequency ranging from 42 to 100%, with similar rate for each SNP in mutated and nonmutated families with the only exception of BRCA1 K1183R significantly more frequent in mutated families (P = 0.004); conversely, this SNP and BRCA2 N372H, were more frequently present in breast cancer relatives belonging to families in which pathological BRCA mutations were not present. Furthermore, specific haplotypes were transmitted in all relatives as BRCA1 871Leu-1038Gly, present in both BRCA mutated and nonmutated families, while BRCA2 289His-991Asp-IVS14+53 C>T present only in BRCAX families suggesting the harmful role of these SNPs. In conclusion, analysis of SNPs maps and modality of their transmission could identify further susceptibility markers and provide a basis for a better DNA-based cancer classification.
  Although DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are substrates for homologous recombination (HR) repair, it is becoming apparent that DNA lesions produced at replication forks, for instance by many anticancer drugs, are more significant substrates for HR repair. Cells defective in HR are hypersensitive to a wide variety of anticancer drugs, including those that do not produce DSBs. Several cancers have mutations in or epigenetically silenced HR genes, which explain the genetic instability that drives cancer development. There are an increasing number of reports suggesting that mutation or epigenetic silencing of HR genes explains the sensitivity of cancers to current chemotherapy treatments. Furthermore, there are also many examples of re-expression of HR genes in tumours to explain drug resistance. Emerging data suggest that there are several different subpathways of HR, which can compensate for each other. Unravelling the overlapping pathways in HR showed that BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective cells rely on the PARP protein for survival. This synthetic lethal interaction is now being exploited for selective treatment of BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective cancers with PARP inhibitors. Here, I discuss the diversity of HR and how it impacts on cancer with a particular focus on how HR can be exploited in future anticancer strategies.
  The two far ends of the age at the diagnosis of breast cancer are the age of younger than 35, and that of older than 70. Most probably, these two groups of patients differ in many ways. The aim of our present study was to underline the fact that age at the diagnosis of breast cancer is indeed a prognostic factor. Between October 1995 and March 2009, 80 old and 51 young breast cancer patients were treated at the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Oncotherapy, Semmelweis University, Budapest. The prognostic and predictive factors of the tumors were analysed together with the disease-free and overall survival data. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups concerning the menstrual and reproductive factors, histological characteristics and immunophenotype of the tumors. Tumor size, nodal status and the Nottingham Prognostic Index did not show statistically significant differences. A trend to a shorter disease-free survival, higher rate of distant metastases and disease-specific death was seen in the group of young patients, but it was not significant. Overall survival was significantly shorter in the group of young patients. Therefore, we can state that young patients have a more aggressive disease and worse outcome. There is an increased importance of self examination in these groups, since both age groups are beyond the age limits of the screening population in Hungary. The media and primary school education as well should be involved in educating women concerning this aspect. The individual follow-up of young patients with positive family history should also be established.
  The majority of familial breast and ovarian cancers arise from mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Amplification at the 11q13.5 locus is commonly observed in breast and ovarian cancers. In 2003, Hughes-Davies et al. identified a novel gene (EMSY) at this locus which binds BRCA2 within a region deleted in some cancers. Although little is known about the cellular role of EMSY, indirect evidence suggests that this nuclear protein is capable of silencing the activation potential of BRCA2. In this study we aimed to investigate expression of the EMSY gene and its protein product in sporadic ovarian cancer. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed in 50 ovarian cancer and 17 normal ovarian tissue samples. Overexpression of the EMSY gene was found in 6/50 cases (12%), but in none of the control samples. To determine the EMSY protein by Western blotting, semi-quantitative analysis of the EMSY protein was performed using the Scion Image Gel Analysis Program. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.5. All patients having EMSY overexpression also displayed increased levels of the EMSY protein. Sporadic ovarian cancer shows overexpression of EMSY at a prevalence similar to that found in breast cancer and the overexpression is correlated with the protein level.
  To date, five moderate-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes have been convincingly identified: CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, and NBS1. Moderate-risk breast cancer alleles confer increased breast cancer risks of two to fourfold compared to the 10% risk in the general population. In contrast to the high-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, moderate-risk genes typically have a limited number of variants that confer breast cancer risks. The prevalence of the variants usually varies widely among different geographical or ethnic populations, ranging from essentially absent up to 1.5% (i.e. 'rare' variants). Since moderate-risk breast cancer alleles are clinically not recognizable when inherited as single mutant, one usually encounters them in a polygenic setting and consequently in incomplete cosegregation with the breast cancer phenotype. As a result, discovery of moderate-risk breast cancer genes requires conclusive statistical evidence from association studies of hundreds of breast cancer cases and population-matched controls.
  This study investigated the association between positive genetic diagnosis for BRCA1/2 mutations and sleep quality in Ashkenazi asymptomatic women. Seventy-three women, including 17 asymptomatic BRCA1/2 carriers and 20 non-carriers from the oncogenetic clinic, and 36 community controls, participated in a cross-sectional design. Women completed sociodemographic, clinical, general psychological distress, cancer-related worry (CRW), fatigue and sleep questionnaires in their homes, and wore actigraphs for 5-7 nights. Impaired global subjective sleep quality was demonstrated in BRCA1/2 carriers compared to non-carriers and controls [mean Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) total scores 7.29 +/- 4.34; 3.94 +/- 2.49; 4.21 +/- 2.80, respectively, P = 0.021] and poor sleep quality (PSQI total score >5) was significantly higher in carriers (53%) compared to non-carriers (20%) and controls (28%, P = 0.03). Based on actigraphic measures, sleep latency tended to be longer in carriers compared to counterparts, albeit not significantly. Increased sleep disturbance was related significantly to increased fatigue in the entire sample and in the control group; to psychological distress in the entire sample and in non-carriers; and to CRW in the entire sample. In carriers, sleep disturbance was related strongly but non-significantly to fatigue, psychological distress and CRW. Fatigue and carrier status were significant predictors of sleep quality, accounting for 15.7% of the variance. In conclusion, asymptomatic BRCA1/2 carriers experience poor sleep quality compared to non-carriers and controls. Our study design is unique in that it offers insight regarding the nature of being an asymptomatic carrier, and affords the opportunity to examine factors that may contribute to the development of insomnia in women at risk for breast-ovarian cancer.
  PALB2 physically and functionally connects the proteins encoded by the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast and ovarian cancer genes into a DNA-damage-response network. However, it remains unclear how these proteins associate with chromatin that contains damaged DNA. We show here that PALB2 binds directly to a conserved chromodomain protein, MRG15, which is a component of histone acetyltransferase-deacetylase complexes. This interaction was identified by analysis of purified MRG15- and PALB2-containing protein complexes. Furthermore, MRG15 interacts with the entire BRCA complex, which contains BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51. Interestingly, MRG15-deficient cells, similarly to cells deficient in PALB2 or BRCA2, showed reduced efficiency for homology-directed DNA repair and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Additionally, knockdown of MRG15 diminished the recruitment of PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage and reduced chromatin loading of PALB2 and BRCA2. These results suggest that MRG15 mediates DNA-damage-response functions of the BRCA complex in chromatin.
  The incomplete penetrance of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 suggests that some combination of environmental and genetic factors modifies the risk of breast cancer in mutation carriers. This study sought to identify possible interactions between established breast cancer risk factors and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations using a case-only study design. Breast cancer cases that had been tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified from 11 collaborating centers. Comparisons of reproductive and lifestyle risk factors were made between women with breast cancer who were positive for BRCA1 mutations (n = 283), BRCA2 mutations (n = 204), or negative for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (n = 894). Interaction risk ratios (IRRs) were calculated using multinominal logistic regression models. Compared with non-carriers, statistically significant IRRs were observed for later age at menarche among BRCA2 mutation carriers, for a greater number of pregnancies among both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and for alcohol use among BRCA1 mutation carriers. Our data suggest that the risk for breast cancer among BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers may be modified by reproductive characteristics and alcohol use. However, our results should be interpreted cautiously given the overall inconsistency in the epidemiologic literature on modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2.
  Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with a significantly increased lifetime risk for developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. However, incomplete penetrance and substantial variability in age of disease onset among carriers of the same mutation suggests the involvement of additional modifier genes and/or environmental factors. Somatic inactivating mutations in the p53 gene and genes of the p53 pathway often accompany BRCA1/2-associated tumors. Therefore, we assessed whether these genes are modifiers of penetrance. We genotyped Jewish-Ashkenazi women for functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AKT1 (C>T rs3730358) and the PERP (C>T rs2484067) genes that affect p53-mediated apoptosis, as well as two tag-SNPs in the CHEK2 (C>T rs743184) and the ZBRK1/ZNF350 (G>A rs2278414) genes that encode for proteins involved in growth arrest following DNA damage. The study population included 138 healthy women, 148 breast/ovarian cancer BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, 121 asymptomatic BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and 210 sporadic noncarrier breast cancer patients. Utilizing lambda(2) and Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95% CI: 1.44-54, P = 0.0184) for the TT genotype of AKT (rs3730358), HR = 2.105 (95% CI: 1.049-7.434, P = 0.039) for CHEK2 CC genotype (rs743184), and HR = 2.4743 (95% CI: 1.205-11.53, P = 0.022) for the AG genotype of ZBRK1/ZNF350 (rs2278414). No significant association between PERP variants and cancer was identified HR = 0.662 (95% CI: 0.289-1.324, P = 0.261). Our results suggest that genes that act upstream of p53, or participate in the DNA damage response, may modify the risk of cancer in women with mutant BRCA1/2 alleles.
  BACKGROUND: Several authors have proposed the use of patients with double primary malignancies affecting the same or contralateral organ as a genetically enriched resource of cases for epidemiologic case-control studies in cancer. Such an approach is based on the assumption that the factors that increase the risk of a second primary are the same ones which influence the risk of a first primary. The advantages for statistical power are premised on the assumption that relative risks in survivors of a first primary cancer are similar to relative risks in the unaffected population. We explore these assumptions theoretically and empirically using published data from breast cancer studies involving bilateral breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a literature review to identify case-control studies of variants in 4 genes known to affect breast cancer risk: CHEK2*1100delC; multiple variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2; and FGFR2 rs2981582. Summary odds ratios were obtained for each of 3 study designs: a conventional case-control design, the design comparing bilateral cases with unilateral controls, and the design comparing bilateral cases with population controls. RESULTS: The data show strong patterns of steadily increasing prevalence of risk factors from healthy controls to primary cases to bilateral cases, as expected. Relative risks in survivors of unilateral breast cancer are either the same as in the general population, or modestly attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with double primary malignancies are a very important underused resource for cancer epidemiologic investigation. Such patients are especially useful for broad genome-wide discovery studies, and for studies of rare, strong risk factors such as high penetrance genes.
  BACKGROUND: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional screening methods improves sensitivity in high-risk patients without benefits on specific survival. We evaluated the characteristics, treatments, and prognostic features of breast cancers diagnosed among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers either inside or outside screening programs that included MRI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients diagnosed with a new breast cancer between 2001 and 2007 were compared: group 1, patients included in an intensive screening program; and group 2, patients outside of this program. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria for group 1, and 102 for group 2. Seventy-four percent and 65%, respectively, were BRCA1 mutation carriers. Tumors in both groups had the same characteristics (pN, grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 expression), except for smaller tumor size in group 1 (median, 6 mm vs. 22 mm; P < .0001). Group 1 patients had more frequent sentinel node procedures (57% vs. 28%; P = .021) and less commonly received chemotherapy (43% vs. 86%; P < .0001). The 3-year disease-free survival (93% vs. 74%; P = .1) and the 3-year overall survival (100% vs. 92%; P = .2) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: MRI might provide improvement in BRCA1/2 carriers in terms of smaller tumor size and treatment morbidity. However, because of aggressive intrinsic characteristics, this does not turn into significant survival benefits.
  The Rad51 protein is essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination. After DNA damage, Rad51 localizes to nuclear foci that represent sites of DNA repair in vivo. In vitro, Rad51 self-assembles on single- or double-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. Recently, the merging of innovative single-molecule techniques with ensemble methods has provided unique insights into the dynamic nature of this filament and its cellular function. The assembly and disassembly of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments is seen to be regulated by recombination accessory proteins. In this regard, the BRC repeats of the BRCA2 protein were shown to modulate the DNA binding selectivity of Rad51. Furthermore, single-molecule studies explained the need for a DNA translocase, Rad54 protein, in the disassembly of Rad51 double-stranded DNA filaments.
  No study has evaluated the performance of BRCA1/2 mutations prediction models in male breast cancer (MBC) series. Although rare, MBC deserves attention because male and female breast cancers share many characteristics, including the involvement of genetic predisposition factors such as BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, the occurrence of MBC is a commonly used criterion to select families for BRCA mutation testing. We evaluated the performance and clinical effectiveness of four different predictive models in a population-based series of 102 Italian MBC patients characterized for BRCA1/2 mutations. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for each risk model at the 10% threshold. The area under the ROC (AUC) curves and its corresponding asymptotic 95% CIs were calculated as a measure of the accuracy. In our study, the BRCAPRO version 5.0 had the highest combination of sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV for the combined probability and for the discrimination of BRCA2 mutations. In individuals with negative breast-ovarian cancer family history, BRCAPRO 5.0 reached a high discriminatory capacity (AUC=0.92) in predicting BRCA2 mutations and showed values of sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of 0.5, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.67, respectively, for the combined probability. BRCAPRO version 5.0 can be particularly useful in dealing with non-familial MBC, a circumstance that often represents a challenging situation in genetic counseling.
  BACKGROUND: There are relatively few articles addressing long-term follow-up in women with breast cancer at very young ages. METHODS: We have updated and extended our population-based analysis of breast cancer diagnosed at the age < or =30 years in North-west England to include an extra 15 patients with mutation testing in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53, with 115 of 288 consecutive cases being tested. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to assess overall survival, contralateral breast cancer and other second primaries. RESULTS: Survival analysis of all 288 patients showed poor overall survival, although this improved from a 15-year survival of only 46% in those diagnosed between 1980 and 1989 to 58% in those diagnosed between 1990 and 1997 (P=0.05). Contralateral breast cancer rates were at a steady rate of 0.6 per 1000, although the rates in mutation carriers were approximately 2 per 1000. Altogether, 16 BRCA1, 9 BRCA2 and 6 TP53 mutations have now been found among the 115 cases on whom DNA analysis has been performed. BRCAPRO accurately predicted the number of carriers for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and was sensitive and specific at the 10 and 20% threshold, respectively. However, BRCAPRO did not seem to give any weight to DCIS, which accounted for two BRCA1 carriers and three TP53 carriers and overpredicted mutations at the high end of the spectrum, with only 6 of 11 (54%) with a >90% probability having identifiable BRCA1/2 mutations. INTERPRETATION: Rates of new primaries are predicted to some extent by mutation status. BRCAPRO is useful at determining those patients aged < or =30 years to be tested.
  Background: Limited empirical data are available on the effects of genetic counseling and testing among African American women. Objective: To evaluate the effects of genetic counseling and testing in African American women based on different levels of exposure: (a) women who were randomized to culturally tailored (CTGC) and standard genetic counseling (SGC) to women who declined randomization (non-randomized group), (b) participants and non-participants in genetic counseling, and (c) BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) test result acceptors and decliners. Design: Randomized trial of genetic counseling conducted from February 2003 to November 2006. Measures: We evaluated changes in perceived risk of developing breast cancer and cancer worry. Results: Women randomized to CTGC and SGC did not differ in terms of changes in risk perception and cancer worry compared to decliners. However, counseling participants had a significantly greater likelihood of reporting reductions in perceived risk compared to non-participants (p = 0.03). Test result acceptors also had a significantly greater likelihood of reporting decreases in cancer worry (p = 0.03). However, having a cancer history (p = 0.03) and a BRCA1/2 prior probability (p = 0.04) were associated with increases in cancer worry. Conclusions: Although CTGC did not lead to significant improvements in perceived risk or psychological functioning, African American women may benefit from genetic counseling and testing. Continued efforts should be made to increase access to genetic counseling and testing among African American women at increased risk for hereditary disease. But, follow-up support may be needed for women who have a personal history of cancer and those with a greater prior probability of having a BRCA1/2 mutation.
  The effectiveness of radiotherapy treatment could be significantly improved if tumor cells could be rendered more sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) without altering the sensitivity of normal tissues. However, many of the key therapeutically exploitable mechanisms that determine intrinsic tumor radiosensitivity are largely unknown. We have conducted a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of 200 genes involved in DNA damage repair aimed at identifying genes whose knockdown increased tumor radiosensitivity. Parallel siRNA screens were conducted in irradiated and unirradiated tumor cells (SQ20B) and irradiated normal tissue cells (MRC5). Using gammaH2AX foci at 24 hours after IR, we identified several genes, such as BRCA2, Lig IV, and XRCC5, whose knockdown is known to cause increased cell radiosensitivity, thereby validating the primary screening end point. In addition, we identified POLQ (DNA polymerase ) as a potential tumor-specific target. Subsequent investigations showed that POLQ knockdown resulted in radiosensitization of a panel of tumor cell lines from different primary sites while having little or no effect on normal tissue cell lines. These findings raise the possibility that POLQ inhibition might be used clinically to cause tumor-specific radiosensitization.
  DNA damage repair and checkpoint responses prevent genome instability and provide a barrier to the development of cancer. Inherited mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes such as those that encode the homologous recombination (HR) proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause cancer predisposition syndromes. PARP inhibitors are an exciting new class of targeted therapy for treating patients with HR repair-defective tumors. In this study, we use an RNAi screen to identify genes that when silenced cause synthetic lethality with the PARP inhibitor AZD2281. This screen identified the deubiquitylating enzyme USP11 as a participant in HR repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Silencing USP11 with siRNA leads to spontaneous DDR activation in otherwise undamaged cells and hypersensitivity to PARP inhibition, ionizing radiation, and other genotoxic stress agents. Moreover, we demonstrate that HR repair is defective in USP11-silenced cells. Finally, the recruitment of a subset of double-strand break repair proteins including RAD51 and 53BP1 to repair foci is misregulated in the absence of USP11 catalytic activity. Thus, our synthetic lethal approach identified USP11 as a component of the HR double-strand break repair pathway.
  Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer. Previously, the techniques available allowed only for the identification of small genomic alterations, but the dawn of new technology now allows for the rapid detection of large genomic rearrangements (LGRs). LGRs in BRCA1 are responsible for between 0 and 27% of all BRCA1 disease-causing mutations identified in numerous populations. Such alterations are far less common in the BRCA2 gene. To determine the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 LGRs in South Africa, 52 hereditary breast and/or ovarian South African families (36 were Afrikaners) were screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 LGRs using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. These patients were previously shown to be BRCA1 and BRCA2 small mutation negative. One LGR was detected in BRCA1 in a South African family with Greek ancestry. This is a novel deletion of both exons 23 and 24 (NG_005905.2:g.169527_180579del). This first study of BRCA rearrangements in South Africa reveals that LGRs comprise ~3% of identified BRCA1 mutations, a low rate in comparison to other populations. In addition, we have reviewed all 98 previously characterized BRCA1/2 LGRs and re-named them according to the recommended HGVS nomenclature, using the recently released RefSeqGene records, NG_005905.2 and NG_012772.1 for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A standardized resource is now provided which will assist researchers in determining whether their LGRs are novel. Furthermore, we have clarified some of the previously misunderstood rules of nomenclature, which will make uniform reporting of BRCA1/2 easier in the future.
  We report a novel complex mutation that consists of a deletion of 12 bp and an insertion of 2 bp (c.8402_8413del12ins2bp) in the exon 18 of the BRCA2 gene. This is a frameshift mutation that causes a disruption of the translational reading frame resulting in a stop codon downstream in the 2729 position of the BRCA2 protein. The mutation was present in a Spanish hereditary male/female breast cancer family.
  BACKGROUND: Beclin 1, an important autophagy-related protein in human cells, is involved in cell death and cell survival. Beclin 1 mapped to human chromosome 17q21. It is widely expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells. Although down-regulated expression with mono-allelic deletions of beclin 1 gene was frequently observed in breast tumors, whether there was other regulatory mechanism of beclin 1 was to be investigated. We studied the expression of beclin 1 and explored the possible regulatory mechanisms on its expression in breast tumors. METHODS: 20 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues from patients with sporadic breast invasive ductal cancer (IDCs) were collected. The mRNA expression of beclin 1 was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined by real-time quantitative PCR and microsatellite methods. The protein expression of beclin 1, p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. CpG islands in 5' genomic region of beclin 1 gene were identified using MethylPrimer Program. Sodium bisulfite sequencing was used in examining the methylation status of each CpG island. RESULTS: Decreased beclin 1 mRNA expression was detected in 70% of the breast tumors, and the protein levels were co-related to the mRNA levels. Expression of beclin 1 mRNA was demonstrated to be much higher in the BRCA1 positive tumors than that in the BRCA1 negative ones. Loss of heterozygosity was detected in more than 45% of the breast tumors, and a dense cluster of CpG islands was found from the 5' end to the intron 2 of the beclin 1 gene. Methylation analysis showed that the promoter and the intron 2 of beclin 1 were aberrantly methylated in the tumors with decreased expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that LOH and aberrant DNA methylation might be the possible reasons of the decreased expression of beclin 1 in the breast tumors. The findings here shed some new light on the regulatory mechanisms of beclin 1 in breast cancer.
  With the evolving availability of testing for genetic cancer syndromes, oncologists now are increasingly expected to review family histories and to give a genetic risk assessment as part of their care for breast cancer. The most important of these breast cancer genetic syndromes identified to date have been those associated with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Therefore, the proper identification of potentially affected families and providing risk assessment estimates will be ever more essential. This review outlines several different available breast cancer risk assessment models. Risk models for the development of breast cancer as well as risk models that estimate the chance of having a genetic cancer syndrome are discussed. Their clinical applications are also outlined and clinical situations appropriate for each model are reviewed.
  A substantial proportion of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) breast and ovarian cancer families carry one of three founder mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382InsC) and BRCA2 (6174delT). Non-founder mutations are identified in another 2-4% of such families. The extent to which major genomic rearrangements in BRCA contribute to breast and ovarian cancer in the Ashkenazim is not well understood. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). The mean estimated AJ specific pre-test probability of a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 was 24.7% (range: 4.4-88.9%). No genomic rearrangements were identified in either the entire group or in the 26 subjects with pre-test mutation prevalence estimates exceeding 30%. Major gene rearrangements involving the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes appear to contribute little to the burden of inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer in the Ashkenazim.
  BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to compare differences in the prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients at high (H) risk or intermediate slightly (IS) increased risk based on family history and those without a family history of BC, and to evaluate whether ten-year overall survival can be considered a good indicator of BRCA1 gene mutation. METHODS: We classified 5923 breast cancer patients registered between 1988 and 2006 at the Department of Oncology and Haematology in Modena, Italy, into one of three different risk categories according to Modena criteria. One thousand eleven patients at H and IS increased risk were tested for BRCA1/2 mutations. The overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were the study end-points. RESULTS: Eighty BRCA1 carriers were identified. A statistically significantly better prognosis was observed for patients belonging to the H risk category with respect to women in the IS and sporadic groups (82% vs.75% vs.73%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Comparing only BRCA1 carriers with BRCA-negative and sporadic BC (77% vs.77% vs.73%, respectively; p < 0.001) an advantage in OS was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Patients belonging to a population with a high probability of being BRCA1 carriers had a better prognosis than those with sporadic BC. Considering these results, women who previously had BC and had survived ten years could be selected for BRCA1 analysis among family members at high risk of hereditary BC during genetic counselling. Since only 30% of patients with a high probability of having hereditary BC have BRCA1 mutations, selecting women with a long term survival among this population could increase the rate of positive analyses, avoiding the use of expensive tests.
  Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer due to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is the most common cause of hereditary forms of both breast and ovarian cancer. The overall prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations is estimated to be from 1 in 400 to 1 in 800 with a higher prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1 in 40). Estimates of penetrance (cancer risk) vary considerably depending on the context in which they were derived and have been shown to vary within families with the same BRCA1/2 mutation. This suggests there is no exact risk estimate that can be applied to all individuals with a BRCA1/2 mutation. The likelihood of harboring a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is dependent on one's personal and/or family history of cancer and can be estimated using various mutation probability models. For those individuals who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, several screening and primary prevention options have been suggested, including prophylactic surgery and chemoprevention. Once a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial mutation and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is diagnosed.
  PURPOSE: Most BRCA1/2 mutations are of unknown clinical relevance. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that there can be deleterious effects through the disruption of the splicing process. We have investigated the effect of aberrant splicing of BRCA1/2 on hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA variants were analyzed with splicing prediction programs to select putative splicing mutations. Splicing assays of 57 genetic variants were done by lymphocyte reverse transcription-PCR and/or hybrid minigenes in HeLa and nontumor breast epithelial cells. RESULTS: Twenty-four BRCA1/2 variants of Spanish HBOC patients were bioinformatically preselected. Functional assays showed that 12 variants induced anomalous splicing patterns, 6 of which accounted for 58.5% of BRCA1 families. To further evaluate the defective splicing of BRCA1/2, we analyzed 31 Breast Cancer Information Core Database (BIC) and two artificial variants that were generated by mutagenesis. Sixteen variants induced different degrees of aberrant splicing. Altogether, anomalous splicing was caused by 28 BRCA1/2 variants of all types, indicating that any DNA change can disrupt pre-mRNA processing. We show that a wide range of regulatory elements can be involved, including the canonical and cryptic splice sites, the polypyrimidine tract, and splicing enhancers/silencers. Twenty mutations were predicted to truncate the BRCA proteins and/or to delete essential domains, thus supporting a role in HBOC. CONCLUSIONS: An important fraction of DNA variants of BRCA1/2 presents splicing aberrations that may represent a relevant disease-causing mechanism in HBOC. The identification of splicing disruptions by functional assays is a valuable tool to discriminate between benign polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations.
  PURPOSE: Increased prostate cancer risk has been reported for BRCA mutation carriers, but BRCA-associated clinicopathologic features have not been clearly defined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined BRCA mutation prevalence in 832 Ashkenazi Jewish men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 1988 and 2007 and 454 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and compared clinical outcome measures among 26 BRCA mutation carriers and 806 noncarriers. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare age of diagnosis and Gleason score, and logistic regression models were used to determine associations between carrier status, prostate cancer risk, and Gleason score. Hazard ratios (HR) for clinical end points were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: BRCA2 mutations were associated with a 3-fold risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.52-6.66; P = 0.002] and presented with more poorly differentiated (Gleason score > or =7) tumors (85% versus 57%; P = 0.0002) compared with non-BRCA-associated prostate cancer. BRCA1 mutations conferred no increased risk. After 7,254 person-years of follow-up, and adjusting for clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and treatment, BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher risk of recurrence [HR (95% CI), 2.41 (1.23-4.75) and 4.32 (1.31-13.62), respectively] and prostate cancer-specific death [HR (95% CI), 5.48 (2.03-14.79) and 5.16 (1.09-24.53), respectively] than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA2 mutation carriers had an increased risk of prostate cancer and a higher histologic grade, and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were associated with a more aggressive clinical course. These results may have implications for tailoring clinical management of this subset of hereditary prostate cancer.
  PALB2 is a recently discovered breast cancer susceptibility gene, and mutations in the gene have been demonstrated to confer about twofold higher risk of breast cancer. Truncating mutations in PALB2 gene have been identified in varied populations. However, PALB2's significance to breast cancer has not been investigated in the Korean population. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of PALB2 1592delT and 229delT mutations in 300 Korean breast cancer patients diagnosed with either familial or early-onset breast cancer. All patients were confirmed negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Neither 1592delT nor 229delT mutations was found in any of the study cohort. Our results imply that these mutations are absent or rare in Korean patients who are negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We found no evidence to recommend screening for these mutations in the Korean population. However, PALB2 mutations have been demonstrated infrequent and inhomogeneous across investigated populations. Thus, screening the whole PALB2 gene for novel mutations is required to elucidate its significance in predisposition to breast cancer in Korean women.
  It is now understood that epigenetic alterations occur frequently in sporadic breast carcinogenesis, but little is known about the epigenetic alterations associated with familial breast tumors. We performed genome-wide DNA-methylation profiling on familial breast cancers (n = 33) to identify patterns of methylation specific to the different mutation groups (BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAx) or intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (basal, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-amplified, and normal-like). We used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) on Affymetrix promoter chips to interrogate methylation profiles across 25,500 distinct transcripts. Using a support vector machine classification algorithm, we demonstrated that genome-wide methylation profiles predicted tumor mutation status with estimated error rates of 19% (BRCA1), 31% (BRCA2), and 36% (BRCAx) but did not accurately predict the intrinsic subtypes defined by gene expression. Furthermore, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified a distinct subgroup of BRCAx tumors defined by methylation profiles. We validated these findings in the 33 tumors in the test set, as well as in an independent validation set of 47 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded familial breast tumors, by pyrosequencing and Epityper. Finally, gene-expression profiling and SNP CGH array previously performed on the same samples allowed full integration of methylation, gene-expression, and copy-number data sets, revealing frequent hypermethylation of genes that also displayed loss of heterozygosity, as well as of genes that show copy-number gains, providing a potential mechanism for expression dosage compensation. Together, these data show that methylation profiles for familial breast cancers are defined by the mutation status and are distinct from the intrinsic subtypes.
  PURPOSE: Several in vitro studies suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers present increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Different assays for the assessment of deoxyribonucleic acid double-strand break repair capacity have been used, but results are rather inconsistent. Given the concerns about the possible risks of breast screening with mammography in mutation carrier women and the potentially damaging effects of radiotherapy, the purpose of this study was to further investigate the radiosensitivity of this population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The G2 chromosomal radiosensitivity assay was used to assess chromosomal breaks in lymphocyte cultures after exposure to 1 Gy. A group of familiar breast cancer patients carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene (n = 15) and a group of healthy mutation carriers (n = 5) were investigated and compared with a reference group of healthy women carrying no mutation (n = 21). RESULTS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers had a significantly higher number of mean chromatid breaks per cell (p = 0.006) and a higher maximum number of breaks (p = 0.0001) as compared with their matched controls. Both healthy carriers and carriers with a cancer history were more radiosensitive than controls (p = 0.002 and p = 0.025, respectively). Age was not associated with increased radiosensitivity (p = 0.868). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers show enhanced radiosensitivity, presumably because of the involvement of the BRCA genes in deoxyribonucleic acid repair and cell cycle control mechanisms.
  This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of an enhanced counselling (EC) intervention on knowledge about the heritability of breast and ovarian cancer and distress, as a function of BRCA test result, among high-risk women. Before deciding about whether or not to undergo genetic testing, participants were randomly assigned to the EC intervention (N = 69), designed to promote cognitive and affective processing of cancer risk information (following the standard individualised counselling session), or to the control condition (N = 65), which involved standard individualised counselling followed by a general health information session to control for time and attention. Women in the EC group exhibited greater knowledge than women in the control group, 1 week after the intervention. Further, at the affective level, the intervention was found to be the most beneficial for women testing positive: specifically 1 week after test result disclosure, women in the intervention group who tested positive experienced lower levels of distress than women in the control group who tested positive. The findings suggest that the design of counselling aids should include a component that explicitly activates the individual's cognitive-affective processing system.
  Accurate estimations of lifetime risks of breast and ovarian cancer are crucial for counselling women from BRCA1/2 families. We therefore determined breast and ovarian cancer penetrance in BRCA1/2 mutation families in the northern Netherlands and compared them with the incidence of cancers in the general population in this region. We identified 1188 female mutation carriers and first-degree female relatives in 185 families with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The occurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer and ovarian cancer was recorded. The cumulative incidence of breast cancer by age 70 was 71.4% (95% CI 67.2-82.4%) in BRCA1 and 87.5% (82.4-92.6%) in BRCA2 mutation carriers. For ovarian cancer at age 70, it was 58.9% (53.5-64.3%) in BRCA1 and 34.5% (25.0-44.0%) in BRCA2 mutation carriers. For breast cancer we saw a rise of 24.2% in the cumulative incidence in the seventh decade for BRCA2 mutation carriers versus 6.3% for BRCA1. For ovarian cancer the rise in the seventh decade was 17.3% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 15.1% for BRCA2. The 10-year risk for contralateral breast cancer was 34.2% (29.4-39.0%) in BRCA1 families and 29.2% (22.9-35.5%) in BRCA2. We show that the incidence of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers and of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers is still high after 60 years. This may justify intensive breast screening as well as oophorectomy even after age 60. The risk of contralateral breast cancer rises approximately 3% per year, which may affect preventive choices.
  BACKGROUND: BRCA2 gene expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle in human breast cells. The expression of BRCA2 gene is silenced at the G0/G1 phase of cell growth and is de-silenced at the S/G2 phase. While studying the activity of BRCA2 gene promoter in breast cancer cells, we discovered that this promoter has bi-directional activity and the product of the reverse activity (a ZAR1-like protein, we named ZAR2) silences the forward promoter at the G0/G1 phase of the cell. Standard techniques like cell synchronization by serum starvation, flow cytometry, N-terminal or C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged protein expression, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, dual luciferase assay for promoter evaluation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were employed during this study. RESULTS: Human BRCA2 gene promoter is active in both the forward and the reverse orientations. This promoter is 8-20 fold more active in the reverse orientation than in the forward orientation when the cells are in the non-dividing stage (G0/G1). When the cells are in the dividing state (S/G2), the forward activity of the promoter is 5-8 folds higher than the reverse activity. The reverse activity transcribes the ZAR2 mRNA with 966 nt coding sequence which codes for a 321 amino acid protein. ZAR2 has two C4 type zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus. In the G0/G1 growth phase ZAR2 is predominantly located inside the nucleus of the breast cells, binds to the BRCA2 promoter and inhibits the expression of BRCA2. In the dividing cells, ZAR2 is trapped in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA2 gene promoter has bi-directional activity, expressing BRCA2 and a novel C4-type zinc finger containing transcription factor ZAR2. Subcellular location of ZAR2 and its expression from the reverse promoter of the BRCA2 gene are stringently regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner. ZAR2 binds to BRCA2/ZAR2 bi-directional promoter in vivo and is responsible, at least in part, for the silencing of BRCA2 gene expression in the G0/G1 phase in human breast cells.
  Recent preclinical data have demonstrated that pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells with defects in the Fanconi anemia/BRCA2 pathway are hypersensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents. The challenge is to efficiently identify patients who will benefit from these therapies. Patients were chosen for this study by evaluating personal history, ethnic background and family history of pancreatic malignancy. Molecular assays were performed on tissue samples. Patient A developed PDA in the context of a known BRCA2 frameshift mutation (2157delG), suspected because of her personal and multigenerational family history of breast cancer. She was treated with surgical resection, and targeted chemotherapy. Patient A continues to be disease free 32 months after her diagnosis and treatment. Patient B developed PDA in the context of a strong family history of PDA and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Genetic analysis on critical DNA repair genes revealed no alterations. This patient did not receive a tailored treatment regimen. This study highlights the challenge of treating PDA patients and selecting those eligible for targeted therapy. The current targeted treatment options for PDA are reviewed. A new multidisciplinary approach for stratifying PDA patients for promising targeted adjuvant therapy and familial risk counseling is proposed.
  BACKGROUND: Responses following BRCA1/2 genetic testing are relevant for the comprehension of risk status and may play a role in risk management decision making. The objective of this study was to evaluate a psychosocial telephone counseling (PTC) intervention delivered to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers following standard genetic counseling (SGC). We examined the effect of the intervention on distress and the concerns related to genetic testing. METHODS: This prospective randomized clinical trial included 90 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. We measured anxiety, depression, and genetic testing distress outcomes at intervention baseline and 6 and 12 months following disclosure. We evaluated the effects of SGC versus SGC plus PTC on psychological outcomes using intention-to-treat analyses through generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: At 6 months, PTC reduced depressive symptoms (Z = -2.25, P = 0.02) and genetic testing distress (Z = 2.18, P = 0.02) compared with SGC. Furthermore, women in the intervention condition reported less clinically significant anxiety at 6 months (chi(2)(1) = 4.11, P = 0.04) than women who received SGC. We found no differences in outcomes between the intervention groups at the 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: As an adjunct to SGC, PTC delivered following disclosure of positive BRCA1/2 test results seems to offer modest short-term benefits for distress and anxiety. These results build upon a growing literature of psychosocial interventions for BRCA1/2 carriers and, given the potential impact of affect on risk management decision making, suggest that some carriers may derive benefits from adjuncts to traditional genetic counseling.
  Previous small scale studies reported that deleterious BRCA2 and CDKN2a germline mutations contribute to a subset of families with inherited pancreatic cancer. As the prevalence of those mutations in the setting of familial pancreatic cancer is still not well defined for the German population, we evaluated the presence of BRCA2 and CDKN2a germline mutations in a large cohort of familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) families from the German National Case Collection for Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FaPaCa). Fifty-six FPC families with at least two-first-degree relatives with confirmed pancreatic cancer that did not fulfill the criteria of other tumor predisposition syndromes, were analyzed for BRCA2 and CDKN2a germline mutations by DHPLC and/or direct sequencing. No deleterious CDKN2a mutations were identified in our families suggesting that CDKN2a mutations are unlikely to predispose PC in FPC families without melanoma. No deleterious BRCA2 mutations, but 6 unclassified variants, were detected in our FPC collection. Combining the prevalence of deleterious BRCA2 germline mutations from our previous separate study with the data from this study we were able to much more accurately estimate the BRCA2 carrier frequency for FPC families in the German population. A total of two mutations and 6 unclassified variants (mutation range: 2.8-11.4%) were thus identified in 70 German FPC families, indicating that the prevalence of BRCA2 mutations in the German FPC population is less frequent than previously reported.
  Male breast cancer accounts for around 1% of all breast cancer cases, but the incidence has increased over the past 25 years. The rarity of this entity precludes prospective randomized clinical trials. Although breast carcinoma in both genders share certain characteristics, notable differences have emerged. Familial cases usually have BRCA2 rather than BRCA1 mutations. Klinefelter syndrome is the strongest risk factor for developing male breast carcinoma. Men tend to be diagnosed at an older age than women. Presentation is usually a painless lump, but is often late, with more than 40% of individuals having stage III or IV disease. When survival is adjusted for age at diagnosis and stage of disease, outcomes for male and female patients with breast cancer is similar. Surgery is usually mastectomy with axillary clearance or sentinel node biopsy. Because 90% of tumors are hormonal receptor positive, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy. Indications for radiotherapy and chemotherapy are similar to female breast cancer. For metastatic disease, hormonal therapy is the main treatment, but chemotherapy can also provide palliation.

  BACKGROUND: Mutations in the BRCA genes confer greater risk of developing breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Families carrying the mutation can have intensive surveillance and take preventative measures. This is the first report on the uptake of such interventions in Chinese mutation carriers residing in Asia. METHODS: Breast and ovarian cancer index patients and family members referred for genetic counselling and testing who are found to carry the BRCA mutations were included in this multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer were found to carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Forty-one tested family members also carried the mutations. Of the females, 85.7% of the index patients opted for breast surveillance and 23.8% for prophylactic mastectomy. Of the family members, 82.4% chose breast surveillance and 17.7% had prophylactic mastectomy. The majority of index patients and family members preferred ovarian surveillance (84 and 82.4%). Amongst the index patients, 32% decided for prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy; 17.6% of the family members who did not have history of ovarian cancer decided to have prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. All male index patients agreed to breast and prostate surveillance, including breast clinical examination and PSA monitoring. For those male family members found to be BRCA mutation carriers, 56.3% agreed to have breast surveillance and 66.7% agreed to have prostate surveillance. No index patient or family member agreed to any form of chemoprevention. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese BRCA mutation carriers have a higher uptake of cancer surveillance than prophylactic surgery and have a lack of interest in the use of chemoprevention drugs.
  OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the population referred to the Maritime Medical Genetics Service (MMGS) because of increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer, and to evaluate the MMGS referral criteria for this population. METHODS: We reviewed a retrospective cohort of patients at increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer (n = 574) with appointments between January 2001 and May 2007 at the MMGS. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics in Filemaker Pro 8.5v1 and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Among 574 patients, 253 (44%) had test results available at the time of data collection, and 65 (25.7%) had BRCA mutations (44 BRCA1 and 21 BRCA2). Positive test results for each referral criterion ranged from 0% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Use of referral criteria at the MMGS yielded higher rates of positive test results than previously thought. It may be beneficial to expand testing criteria to ensure that everyone who may carry a mutation is offered testing.
  Penetrances of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been derived from retrospective studies, implying the possibility of ascertainment biases to influence the results.We have followed women at risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer for two decades, and report the prospectively observed age-related annual incidence rates to contract breast or ovarian cancer for women with deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations based on 4830 observation years. Patients were grouped according to mutation, age and having/not having had previous cancer.In women not having had previous cancer and aged 40-59 years, the annual incidence rate to contract breast or ovarian cancer in those having the most frequent BRCA1 founder mutations was 4.0%, for women in this age group and with less frequent BRCA1 mutations annual incidence rate was 5.9%, and for women with BRCA2 mutations 3.5%.The observed figures may be used for genetic counseling of healthy mutation carriers in the respective age groups. The results may indicate that less frequent BRCA1 mutations have higher penetrances than BRCA1 founder mutations.
  BACKGROUND: Women from families with a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer in which genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes is inconclusive are a vulnerable and understudied group. Furthermore, there are no studies of the professional specialists who treat them - geneticists, genetic counsellors/nurses, oncologists, gynaecologists and breast surgeons. METHODS: We conducted a small qualitative study that investigated women who had developed breast cancer under the age of 45 and who had an inconclusive BRCA1/2 genetic diagnostic test (where no mutations or unclassified variants were identified). We arranged three focus groups for affected women and their close female relatives - 13 women took part. We also interviewed 12 health professionals who were involved in the care of these women. RESULTS: The majority of the women had a good grasp of the meaning of their own or a family member's inconclusive result, but a few indicated some misunderstanding. Most of the women in this study underwent the test for the benefit of others in the family and none mentioned that they were having the test purely for themselves. A difficult issue for sisters of affected women was whether or not to undertake prophylactic breast surgery. The professionals were sensitive to the difficulties in explaining an inconclusive result. Some felt frustrated that technology had not as yet provided them with a better tool for prediction of risk. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the women were left with the dilemma of what decision to make regarding medical management of their cancer risk. For the most part, the professionals believed that the women should be supported in whatever management decisions they considered best, provided these decisions were based on a complete and accurate understanding of the genetic test that had taken place in the family.
  Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is widely used for cancer risk reduction in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation carriers. Occult ovarian/fallopian tube cancers (OOC) detected at the time of RRSO have been reported in several studies with wide variability in reported prevalence. We estimated the prevalence of OOC in a prospective cohort of 647 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from 18 centers (PROSE consortium) who underwent RRSO between 2001 and 2008. OOC was detected in 16 of 647 women (2.5%). The mean age at RRSO was 51.7 in those with OOC versus 46.6 in those without OOC (P = 0.017). Twelve of the 16 OOCs (75%) were diagnosed in women with BRCA1 mutations. Thirty-eight percent of women with OOC had stage 1 cancer versus none of the women in the PROSE database diagnosed with ovarian cancer outside of screening. Among 385 women (60%) in whom pathology reports were available for central review, 246 (64%) RRSOs were performed at participating PROSE centers while 139 (36%) were performed at local sites. Ovarian and fallopian tube tissues removed at major genetics referral centers were significantly more likely to have been examined in toto compared to specimens obtained at non-referral centers (75% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). Our results confirm that OOC may be found at the time of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and suggest that OOC are of a more favorable stage than cancers found outside RRSO. An unacceptably high proportion of pathologic examinations did not adequately examine ovaries and fallopian tubes obtained at RRSO.
  Mitotic homologous recombination promotes genome stability through the precise repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions that are encountered during normal cellular metabolism and from exogenous insults. As a result, homologous recombination repair is essential during proliferative stages in development and during somatic cell renewal in adults to protect against cell death and mutagenic outcomes from DNA damage. Mutations in mammalian genes encoding homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, are associated with developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis. Recent advances have provided a clearer understanding of the connections between these proteins and of the key steps of homologous recombination and DNA strand exchange.
  A large number of rare sequence variants of unknown clinical significance have been identified in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Laboratory-based methods that can distinguish between carriers of pathogenic mutations and non-carriers are likely to have utility for the classification of these sequence variants. To identify predictors of pathogenic mutation status in familial breast cancer patients, we explored the use of gene expression arrays to assess the effect of two DNA-damaging agents (irradiation and mitomycin C) on cellular response in relation to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. A range of regimes was used to treat 27 lymphoblastoid cell-lines (LCLs) derived from affected women in high-risk breast cancer families (nine BRCA1, nine BRCA2, and nine non-BRCA1/2 or BRCAX individuals) and nine LCLs from healthy individuals. Using an RNA-pooling strategy, we found that treating LCLs with 1.2 microM mitomycin C and measuring the gene expression profiles 1 hour post-treatment had the greatest potential to discriminate BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX mutation status. A classifier was built using the expression profile of nine QRT-PCR validated genes that were associated with BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX status in RNA pools. These nine genes could distinguish BRCA1 from BRCA2 carriers with 83% accuracy in individual samples, but three-way analysis for BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX had a maximum of 59% prediction accuracy. Our results suggest that, compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, non-BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) individuals are genetically heterogeneous. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of RNA pools to compare the expression profiles of cell-lines from BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX cases after treatment with irradiation and mitomycin C as a method to prioritize treatment regimes for detailed downstream expression analysis.
  BACKGROUND: Indirect alternatives to sequencing as a method for mutation scanning are of interest to diagnostic laboratories because they have the potential for considerable savings in both time and costs. Ideally, such methods should be simple, rapid, and highly sensitive, and they should be validated formally to a very high standard. Currently, most reported methods lack one or more of these characteristics. We describe the optimization and validation of conformation-sensitive capillary electrophoresis (CSCE) for diagnostic mutation scanning. METHODS: We initially optimized the performance of CSCE with a systematic panel of plasmid-based controls. We then compared manual analysis by visual inspection with automated analysis by BioNumerics software (Applied Maths) in a blinded interlaboratory validation with 402 BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset) and BRCA2 (breast cancer 1, early onset) variants previously characterized by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: With automated analysis, we demonstrated a sensitivity of >99% (95% CI), which is indistinguishable from the sensitivity for conventional sequencing by capillary electrophoresis. The 95% CI for specificity was 90%-93%; thus, CSCE greatly reduces the number of fragments that need to be sequenced to fully characterize variants. By manual analysis, the 95% CIs for sensitivity and specificity were 98.3%-99.4% and 93.1%-95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CSCE is amenable to a high degree of automation, and analyses can be multiplexed to increase both capacity and throughput. We conclude that once it is optimized, CSCE combined with analysis with BioNumerics software is a highly sensitive and cost-effective mutation-scanning technique suitable for routine genetic diagnostic analysis of heterozygous nucleotide substitutions, small insertions, and deletions.
  Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are characterized by deficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. Defective DNA double-strand break repair has been not only implicated as a key contributor to tumorigenesis in mutation carriers but also represents a potential target for therapy. The transcriptional similarities between BRCA1-deficient tumors and sporadic tumors of the basal-like subtype have led to the investigation of homologous recombination repair-directed therapy in triple-negative tumors, which demonstrates overlap with the basal-like subtype. We broaden the scope of this topic by addressing a "repair-defective" rather than "BRCA1-like" phenotype. We discuss structural and functional aspects of key repair proteins including BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1, and partner and localizer of BRCA2 and describe the phenotypic consequences of their loss at the cellular, tissue, and organism level. We review potential mechanisms of repair pathway dysfunction in sporadic tumors and address how the identification of such defects may guide the application of repair-directed therapies.
  BRCA1/2 predictive testing and gender: Uptake, motivation and psychological characteristics: Data on male uptake of BRCA1/2 predictive testing and psychological characteristics of males in comparison to females are scarce. We investigated gender differences in the cohort tested at the Center for Human Genetics in Leuven during a 10-year period (1998-2007). Males were significantly older than females. Breast cancer related distress (IES) was significantly lower in men and was not associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2. The groups of both males and females were psychologically stronger than average (SCL-90, UCL) and self-selected. Men were unanimously motivated (personal relevance of 12 motives rated on a Likert scale) by concern for their daughters, and significantly more so than women. One third of them (versus 12% women) referred to child-bearing decisions. Considering all unaffected siblings in the family of origin, uptake of predictive testing was significantly higher in females. Moreover, uptake was significantly higher in women belonging to a BRCA2 than to a BRCA1 family. In the descendants of identified carriers, uptake was predicted by gender and age, but not by the parent's gender or by BRCA1 or BRCA2 status.
  Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) regulates cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair in response to genotoxic stress. Inhibition of Chk1 is an emerging strategy for potentiating the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we demonstrate that AZD7762, an ATP -competitive Chk1/2 inhibitor induces gammaH2AX in gemcitabine-treated cells by altering both dynamics and stability of replication forks, allowing the firing of suppressed replication origins as measured by DNA fiber combing and causing a dramatic increase in DNA breaks as measured by comet assay. Furthermore, we identify ATM and DNA-PK, rather than ATR, as the kinases mediating gammaH2AX induction, suggesting AZD7762 converts stalled forks into double strand breaks (DSBs). Consistent with DSB formation upon fork collapse, cells deficient in DSB repair by lack of BRCA2, XRCC3 or DNA-PK were selectively more sensitive to combined AZD7762 and gemcitabine. Checkpoint abrogation by AZD7762 also caused premature mitosis in gemcitabine-treated cells arrested in G(1)/early S-phase. Prevention of premature mitotic entry via Cdk1 siRNA knockdown suppressed apoptosis. These results demonstrate that chemosensitization of gemcitabine by Chk1 inhibition results from at least three cellular events, namely, activation of origin firing, destabilization of stalled replication forks and entry of cells with damaged DNA into lethal mitosis. Additionally, the current study indicates that the combination of Chk1 inhibitor and gemcitabine may be particularly effective in targeting tumors with specific DNA repair defects.
  High risk may be defined as either an absolute risk greater than 20 % or a relative risk greater than 4. Concerning breast and ovarian cancer, high risk patients include carriers of a constitutive deleterious mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, patients with a significant family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and patients who have been diagnosed a benign breast lesion with a high risk of degeneration, i.e. atypical hyperplasia. Following up such patients relies on specific strategies. A center including a large panel of physicians involved in the various modalities for patients' management (geneticians, radiologists, gynecologists, plastic surgeons, pathologists, endocrinologists, psychologists, medical oncologists) has been created at Tenon Hospital with this purpose. The collaboration of these different specialists with the referent physician of the patient allows for the definition and the implementation of a patient-centered follow-up continuously updated to take into account the different periods of a woman's life, according to best practices recommendations and the evolving state-of-the art.
  AIM: In a previous cohort study, we showed that there was a significant variation in the frequency of ovarian cancer after having breast cancer in Sweden, with the highest risk occuring in the Western region. The present study aimed to evaluate whether the high prevalence of the founder mutation BRCA1 3171ins5 may explain the excess number of ovarian cancer. METHOD: Among more than 26 000 women with breast cancer in the Western Swedish Health Care Region, 159 cases were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, whereas the expected number was 96. Archived tissue material was analysed for six common Scandinavian BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. RESULTS: The excess number of cases was 63 (95% CI 47-77), based on person-years at risk and national incidence rates of ovarian cancer. A BRCA1 gene mutation was detected in 33 cases corresponding to 52% of the excess number. The founder mutation, BRCA1 3171ins5, was detected in 44% of the excess number. The identified mutations decreased from 45% in women less than 50 years of age at follow-up to 14% at 60+ years at follow-up. There was no obvious decrease in mutation frequency by excess numbers with age. Age at follow-up and first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer were the best predictors of a mutation in this material. CONCLUSION: The founder mutation, BRCA1 3171ins5, explains the excess of ovarian cancer after breast cancer in the region. From the relative frequency of the studied mutations found at the cancer genetic counselling clinic, it is estimated that BRCA1 gene mutations are associated with about 80-85% of the excess cases. This means that a negative screening for these mutations in similar cases may have a predictive value and could strongly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in relatives.
  We report a novel germline 490delCT mutation in BRCA2 gene, detected in a 38-year-old woman with breast cancer. The mutation originates a premature stop at codon 99, leading to a truncated protein, and has not been documented in any published report to the best of our knowledge.
  BACKGROUND: Latinas are less likely to use genetic services (counseling and testing) for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer risk compared to other ethnic groups. Meanwhile, little is known about barriers to genetic counseling among Latinas at increased risk of inherited breast cancer. METHODS: A two-phase pilot study was conducted to examine interest, barriers and beliefs about BRCA genetic counseling among at-risk Latinas in New York City and explore the potential for developing a culturally-tailored narrative educational tool for use in future studies. Phase 1 included quantitative telephone interviews (N = 15) with bilingual participants with a personal diagnosis at a young age and/or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Quantitative results informed development of a narrative prototype educational presentation viewed by a subset of participants (N = 10) in Phase 2 focus groups. RESULTS: Despite barriers, including lack of awareness/knowledge, concerns related to learning cancer risks of family members, and concerns about cost/health insurance, participants reported positive attitudes, beliefs and interest in learning about BRCA genetic counseling. Further, significant increases in knowledge were demonstrated from pre-post presentation (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: There is an unmet need to educate at-risk Latinas about BRCA genetic counseling. Culturally-tailored educational materials including narratives may increase knowledge about BRCA genetic counseling among this underserved group. The effectiveness of these approaches should be tested in future research with larger samples.
  AIM: Women at high risk for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer require specific management strategies for cancer prevention and early detection. The authors sought to determine the prevalence of family histories suggestive of a hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome in patients with a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer in Japanese women. METHODS: Family history (first- and second-degree relatives) data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire for women with a history of breast or ovarian cancer in six major cancer treating hospitals in Niigata prefecture, Japan. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 1463 women: 626 women with a history of breast cancer, 289 women with a history of ovarian cancer and 548 women without a history of any cancer as controls. Women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer had OR of breast cancer of 2.3 (95% confidential interval [CI] 1.5-3.7) and ovarian cancer of 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.8). The risk was higher when the proband was younger or when two or more relatives were affected. Among women with a history of breast or ovarian cancer, 7.5% met the criteria for a 10% risk of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation according to the Myriad model. CONCLUSION: Obtaining a detailed breast and ovarian cancer family history and the application of the Myriad model is useful for identifying women at an elevated genetic risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The estimation for the prevalence of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has significant implications for a patient's management, as well as for the capacity for risk assessment and testing.
  INTRODUCTION: The risk of breast cancer to first degree relatives of breast cancer patients is approximately twice that of the general population. Breast cancer, however, is a heterogeneous disease and it is plausible that the familial relative risk (FRR) for breast cancer may differ by the pathological subtype of the tumour. The contribution of genetic variants associated with breast cancer susceptibility to the subtype-specific FRR is still unclear. METHODS: We computed breast cancer FRR for subtypes of breast cancer by comparing breast cancer incidence in relatives of breast cancer cases from a population-based series with known estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status with that expected from the general population. We estimated the contribution to the FRR of genetic variants associated with breast cancer susceptibility using subtype-specific genotypic relative risks and allele frequencies for each variant. RESULTS: At least one marker was measured for 4,590 breast cancer cases, who reported 9,014 affected and unaffected first-degree female relatives. There was no difference between the breast cancer FRR for relatives of patients with ER-negative (FRR = 1.78, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.44 to 2.11) and ER-positive disease (1.82, 95% CI: 1.67 to 1.98), P = 0.99. There was some suggestion that the breast cancer FRR for relatives of patients with ER-negative disease was higher than that for ER-positive disease for ages of the relative less than 50 years old (FRR = 2.96, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.87; and 2.05, 95% CI: 1.70 to 2.40 respectively; P = 0.07), and that the breast cancer FRR for relatives of patients with ER-positive disease was higher than for ER-negative disease when the age of the relative was greater than 50 years (FRR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.59 to 1.93; and 1.41, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.74 respectively, P = 0.06). We estimated that mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 explain 32% of breast cancer FRR for relatives of patients with ER-negative and 9.4% of the breast cancer FRR for relatives of patients with ER-positive disease. Twelve recently identified common breast cancer susceptibility variants were estimated to explain 1.9% and 9.6% of the FRR to relatives of patients with ER-negative and ER-positive disease respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FRR for breast cancer was significantly increased for both ER-negative and ER-positive disease. Including receptor status in conjunction with genetic status may aid risk prediction in women with a family history.
  BRCA1/2 mutations are the most commonly identified germ line gene mutations in patients with hereditary breast cancer. These proteins have many critical cellular functions, including repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The role of defective BRCA1/2 as a predictor of response to DNA-damaging agents has been studied extensively in preclinical models, but prospective clinical validation is lacking. Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) inhibitors illustrate the concept of synthetic lethality in cells with defective BRCA1/2 and numerous PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in patients with BRCA1/2-associated tumors. BRCA1/2 mutation or functional loss will likely serve as a useful predictive biomarker of response to treatment with PARP inhibitors.
  Significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of female breast cancer, resulting in a decline in incidence and a global improvement in clinical outcome. The statistics for male breast cancer (MBC) stand in sharp contrast-over the past several decades, there has been a steady rise in the incidence of this disease, and clinical outcome has improved at a much slower pace. In the current review, the clinicopathologic features of MBC are described in detail. An emphasis is placed on molecular profiling of MBC, which may identify candidate biomarkers and putative targets for pharmacologic intervention. The current role of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and GnRH analogues) is defined in the context of currently available studies. Furthermore, the potential role of targeted agents, including HER2-directed therapies, PARP inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors, is delineated.
  Large genomic rearrangements (LGR) represent substantial proportion of pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 gene, whereas the frequency of rearrangements in the BRCA2 gene is low in many populations. We screened for LGRs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 521 unrelated patients negative for BRCA1/2 point mutations selected from 655 Czech high-risk breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. Besides long range PCR, a chromosome 17-specific oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used for accurate location of deletions. We identified 14 patients carrying 8 different LGRs in BRCA1 that accounted for 12.3% of all pathogenic BRCA1 mutations. No LGRs were detected in the BRCA2 gene. In a subgroup of 239 patients from high-risk families, we found 12 LGRs (5.0%), whereas two LGRs were revealed in a subgroup of 282 non-familial cancer cases (0.7%). Five LGRs (deletion of exons 1-17, 5-10, 13-19, 18-22 and 21-24) were novel; two LGRs (deletion of exons 5-14 and 21-22) belong to the already described Czech-specific mutations; one LGR (deletion of exons 1-2) was reported from several countries. The deletions of exons 1-17 and 5-14, identified each in four families, represented Czech founder mutations. The present study indicates that screening for LGRs in BRCA1 should include patients from breast or ovarian cancer families as well as high-risk patients with non-familial cancer, in particular cases with early-onset breast or ovarian cancer. On the contrary, our analyses do not support the need to screen for LGRs in the BRCA2 gene. Implementation of chromosome-specific aCGH could markedly facilitate the design of primers for amplification and sequence analysis of junction fragments, especially in deletions overlapping gene boundaries.
  Published data on the association between BRCA2 N372H polymorphism and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Crude ORs with 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of association between them. A total of 22 studies including 22,515 cases and 22,388 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant associations were found between BRCA2 N372H polymorphism and breast cancer risk when all studies pooled into the meta-analysis (NH versus NN: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.97-1.05; HH versus NN: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.97-1.13; dominant model: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98-1.05; and recessive model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.13). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, still no significant associations were found for Caucasians, Asians, or Africans. When stratified by study design, statistically significantly elevated risk was found for 372H allele based on population-based studies (HH versus NN: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01-1.21; dominant model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00-1.10; recessive model: OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.00-1.18). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the BRCA2 372H allele may be a low-penetrant risk factor for developing breast cancer. However, large sample and representative population-based studies with homogeneous breast cancer patients and well matched controls are warranted to confirm this finding.
  Given the greatly elevated risks of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) observed in breast cancer patients who carry mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, it is critical to determine the effectiveness of standard adjuvant therapies in preventing CBC in mutation carriers. The WECARE study is a matched, case-control study of 708 women with CBC as cases and 1,399 women with unilateral breast cancer (UBC) as controls, including 181 BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. Interviews and medical record reviews provided detailed information on risk factors and breast cancer therapy. All study participants were screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to detect genetic variants in the coding and flanking regions of the genes. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare the risk of CBC associated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Chemotherapy was associated with lower CBC risk both in non-carriers (RR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.5-0.7]) and carriers (RR = 0.5 [95% CI: 0.2-1.0]; P value = 0.04). Tamoxifen was associated with a reduced CBC risk in non-carriers (RR = 0.7 [95% CI: 0.6-1.0]; P value = 0.03). We observed a similar but non-significant reduction associated with tamoxifen in mutation carriers (RR = 0.7 [95% CI: 0.3-1.8]). The tests of heterogeneity comparing carriers to non-carriers did not provide evidence for a difference in the associations with chemotherapy (P value = 0.51) nor with tamoxifen (P value = 0.15). Overall, we did not observe a difference in the relative risk reduction associated with adjuvant treatment between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers. However, given the higher absolute CBC risk in mutation carriers, the potentially greater impact of adjuvant therapy in reducing CBC risk among mutation carriers should be considered when developing treatment plans for these patients.
  AIM: To examine the outcome of prophylactic mastectomy in a hospital-based series of BRCA1/2 gene mutation carriers with and without a history of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A center-based consecutive series of 254 BRCA1/2 gene mutation carriers that had prophylactic mastectomy after a normal surveillance round including breast-magnetic resonance imaging were identified. One hundred forty-seven asymptomatic carriers underwent bilateral mastectomy and 107 symptomatic women had contralateral mastectomy after a mean cancer free interval of 3.6 years. All removed breasts were histopathologically examined. RESULTS: In one asymptomatic BRCA2 carrier (0.7%) an occult small invasive breast cancer was diagnosed, while in 6 asymptomatic carriers (4.0% BRCA1 and 4.3% BRCA2) and in 5 symptomatic carriers (2.5% BRCA1 and 10.7% BRCA2) DCIS was detected at prophylactic mastectomy. No breast cancer occurred in the asymptomatic group after a postprophylactic follow-up period of 778 women-years. In the symptomatic carriers 1 invasive breast cancer was detected after 580 follow-up years. From age-, cohort-, and gene-specific reference data we calculated that 15 invasive first cancers in the asymptomatic carriers were prevented during follow-up. CONCLUSION: One invasive breast cancer in 147 bilateral prophylactic mastectomies (0.7%) was detected, this makes a sentinel node procedure redundant and preoperative imaging vital. The prophylactic procedure is highly effective in preventing invasive breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Since the remaining risk is less than 0.2%/woman-year, continued surveillance of the asymptomatic carriers is not warranted.
  OBJECTIVE: Reproductive factors, such as early age at menarche, late age at menopause, and nulliparity are known risk factors for breast cancer. Previously, we reported these factors to be associated with risk of developing contralateral breast cancer (CBC). In this study, we evaluated the association between these factors and CBC risk among BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation carriers and non-carriers. METHODS: The WECARE Study is a population-based multi-center case-control study of 705 women with CBC (cases) and 1,397 women with unilateral breast cancer (controls). All participants were screened for BRCA1/2 mutations and 181 carriers were identified. Conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between reproductive factors and CBC for mutation carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: None of the associations between reproductive factors and CBC risk differed between mutation carriers and non-carriers. The increase in risk with younger age at menarche and decrease in risk in women with more than two full-term pregnancies seen in non-carriers were not significantly different in carriers (adjusted RRs = 1.31, 95% CI 0.65-2.65 and 0.53, 95% CI 0.19-1.51, respectively). No significant associations between the other reproductive factors and CBC risk were observed in mutation carriers or non-carriers. CONCLUSION: For two reproductive factors previously shown to be associated with CBC risk, we observed similar associations for BRCA1/2 carriers. This suggests that reproductive variables that affect CBC risk may have similar effects in mutation carriers and non-carriers.
  Using conventional Sanger sequencing as a reference standard, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, and capacity of the Illumina GA II platform for the detection of TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 mutations in established tumor cell lines and DNA from patients with germline mutations. A total of 656 coding variants were identified in four cell lines and 65 patient DNAs. All of the known pathogenic mutations (including point mutations and insertions/deletions of up to 16 nucleotides) were identified, using a combination of the Illumina data analysis pipeline with custom and commercial sequence alignment software. In our configuration, clonal sequencing outperforms current diagnostic methods, providing a reduction in analysis times and in reagent costs compared with conventional sequencing. These improvements open the possibility of BRCA1/2 testing for a wider spectrum of at-risk women, and will allow the genetic classification of tumors prior to the use of novel PARP inhibitors to treat BRCA-deficient breast cancers.
  Breast cancer is a public health problem in the Western countries. Several studies have shown that BRCA2, like BRCA1 oncosuppressors, are strongly involved in hereditary and sporadic mammary carcinogenesis. It has also been suggested that soy has a protective effect against breast cancer in Asia and, more particularly, phytoestrogens such as daidzein and genistein. Thus, phytoestrogens may have an impact on the expression of BRCA2 gene, and there is a possible link between BRCA2 and genes acting around the BRCA2. To focus on these processes, we set up the BRCA2 specific knockdown by RNA interference in two breast tumor cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and also in a non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-10a). After inhibition of BRCA2 expression, cells were maintained in different conditions and treated with either daidzein or genistein or left untreated. Microarray analysis of mRNAs isolated from the BRCA2 knocked down MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10a cell lines after being treated with phytoestrogens showed 35 differentially expressed genes between positive-ERbeta cells and negative-ERbeta cells. After genistein or daidzein treatments, BRCA1 was found to be up-regulated when knocked down with BRCA2-siRNA MCF-7 and BRCA2 was found to be up-regulated when knocked down with BRCA2-siRNA MDA-MB 231 cells. In MCF-10a, we observed a significant decrease in BAX and BCL2 expressions with a greater effect of daidzein. We also found an increase in BRIP expression between genistein and daidzein treatment knocked down with BRCA2-siRNA MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
  Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibition is toxic to cells with mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, a concept termed synthetic lethality. However, whether this approach is applicable to other human cancers with defects in other DNA repair genes has yet to be determined. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is altered in several human cancers including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we characterize a panel of MCL cell lines for ATM status and function and investigate the potential for synthetic lethality in MCL in the presence of small-molecule inhibitors of PARP-1. We show that Granta-519 and UPN2 cells have low levels of ATM protein, are defective in DNA damage-induced ATM-dependent signaling, are radiation sensitive, and have cell cycle checkpoint defects: all characteristics of defective ATM function. Significantly, Granta-519 and UPN2 cells were more sensitive to PARP-1 inhibition than were the ATM-proficient MCL cell lines examined. Furthermore, the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib (known previously as AZD2281/KU-0059436) significantly decreased tumor growth and increased overall survival in mice bearing s.c. xenografts of ATM-deficient Granta-519 cells while producing only a modest effect on overall survival of mice bearing xenografts of the ATM-proficient cell line, Z138. Thus, PARP inhibitors have therapeutic potential in the treatment of MCL, and the concept of synthetic lethality extends to human cancers with ATM alterations.
  BACKGROUND: PALB2 protein was recently identified as a partner of BRCA1 and BRCA2 which determines their proper function in DNA repair. METHODS: Initially, the entire coding sequence of the PALB2 gene with exon/intron boundaries was evaluated by the PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing methods on 70 ovarian carcinomas. Sequence variants of interest were further studied on enlarged groups of ovarian carcinomas (total 339 non-consecutive ovarian carcinomas), blood samples from 334 consecutive sporadic and 648 consecutive familial breast cancer patients, and 1310 healthy controls from central Poland. RESULTS: Ten types of sequence variants were detected, and among them four novel polymorphisms: c.2996+58T>C in intron 9; c.505C>A (p.L169I), c.618T>G (p.L206L), both in exon 4; and c.2135C>T (A712V) in exon 5 of the PALB2 gene. Another two polymorphisms, c.212-58A>C and c.2014G>C (E672Q) were always detected together, both in cancer (7.5% of patients) and control samples (4.9% of controls, p = 0.2). A novel germline truncating mutation, c.509_510delGA (p.R170fs) was found in exon 4: in 2 of 339 (0.6%) unrelated ovarian cancer patients, in 4 of 648 (0.6%) unrelated familial breast cancer patients, and in 1 of 1310 controls (0.08%, p = 0.1, p = 0.044, respectively). One ovarian cancer patient with the PALB2 mutation had also a germline nonsense mutation of the BRCA2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The c.509_510delGA is a novel PALB2 mutation that increases the risk of familial breast cancer. Occurrence of the same PALB2 alteration in seven unrelated women suggests that c.509_510delGA (p.R170fs) is a recurrent mutation for Polish population.
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging-guided breast vacuum-assisted biopsy (MR-VAB). METHODS: Of 97 scheduled MR-VAB for single MRI lesions (negative second-look sonography) categorised as BI-RADS 4 or 5, 4 were cancelled (undetected lesion = 2, technical problems = 2). Twenty-one patients lost to follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 51 years) were at high risk (BRCA1 = 11, BRCA2 = 7, familial risk = 5), 23 had a suspected local recurrence of breast cancer. Seventy-two imaged lesions (focus = 1, mass enhancement = 32, non-mass-like enhancement = 39) were targeted with a 10-gauge VAB probe using MRI guidance, with a median of 18 specimens per lesion (median procedural time 72 min, range 50-131 min) followed by clip placement. In the case of benignity, MRI follow-up was performed (19 patients, median 389 days, range 33-1,592) or mammography (3 patients, median 420 days, range 372-1,354). According to histopathology results, 29 lesions were benign, 10 were high-risk (papillary = 2, radial scar = 1, atypical epithelial hyperplasia = 7) and 33 malignant (ductal carcinoma in situ = 8, invasive cancers = 25). Three false negative results and 3 complications occurred (1 malaise, 1 skin defect, 1 infection). CONCLUSION: MRI-guided VAB represents an accurate tool for the histological diagnosis of lesions visible only at MRI.
  Several female malignancies including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers can be characterized based on known somatic and germline mutations. Initiation and propagation of tumors reflect underlying genomic alterations such as mutations, polymorphisms, and copy number variations found in genes of multiple cellular pathways. The contributions of any single genetic variation or mutation in a population depend on its frequency and penetrance as well as tissue-specific functionality. Genome wide association studies, fluorescence in situ hybridization, comparative genomic hybridization, and candidate gene studies have enumerated genetic contributors to cancers in women. These include p53, BRCA1, BRCA2, STK11, PTEN, CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, FGFR2, TGFB1, MDM2, MDM4 as well as several other chromosomal loci. Based on the heterogeneity within a specific tumor type, a combination of genomic alterations defines the cancer subtype, biologic behavior, and in some cases, response to therapeutics. Consideration of tumor heterogeneity is therefore important in the critical analysis of gene associations in cancer.
  BRIT1 protein (also known as MCPH1) contains 3 BRCT domains which are conserved in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other important molecules involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor suppression. BRIT1 mutations or aberrant expression are found in primary microcephaly patients as well as in cancer patients. Recent in vitro studies suggest that BRIT1/MCPH1 functions as a novel key regulator in the DNA damage response pathways. To investigate its physiological role and dissect the underlying mechanisms, we generated BRIT1(-/-) mice and identified its essential roles in mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability. Both BRIT1(-/-) mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation. BRIT1(-/-) MEFs and T lymphocytes exhibited severe chromatid breaks and reduced RAD51 foci formation after irradiation. Notably, BRIT1(-/-) mice were infertile and meiotic homologous recombination was impaired. BRIT1-deficient spermatocytes exhibited a failure of chromosomal synapsis, and meiosis was arrested at late zygotene of prophase I accompanied by apoptosis. In mutant spermatocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were formed, but localization of RAD51 or BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired. In addition, we found that BRIT1 could bind to RAD51/BRCA2 complexes and that, in the absence of BRIT1, recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was reduced while their protein levels were not altered, indicating that BRIT1 is involved in mediating recruitment of RAD51/BRCA2 to the damage site. Collectively, our BRIT1-null mouse model demonstrates that BRIT1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability in vivo to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages, and its depletion causes a failure in both mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair via impairing RAD51/BRCA2's function and as a result leads to infertility and genomic instability in mice.
  Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a cancer in which malignant "Reed-Sternberg" cells comprise just a fraction of the bulk of the tumor and are characteristically binucleated. We recently identified a novel gene, KLHDC8B, which appears responsible for some familial cases of cHL. KLHDC8B encodes a midbody kelch protein expressed during cytokinesis. Deficiency of KLHDC8B leads to binucleated cells, implicating its involvement in Reed-Sternberg cell formation. Interestingly, other cancer genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, also encode proteins locating to the midbody during cytokinesis, even though their participation in other pathways has received greater attention. Midbody components may be an overlooked source of tumor suppressor genes.
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening in women at high-risk of breast cancer results in the identification of both unambiguously defined deleterious mutations and sequence variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS). We examined a population-based sample of young women with contralateral breast cancer (CBC, n=705) or unilateral breast cancer (UBC, n=1398). We identified 470 unique sequence variants, of which 113 were deleterious mutations. The remaining 357 VUS comprised 185 unique missense changes, 60% were observed only once, while 3% occurred with a frequency of >10%. Deleterious mutations occurred three times more often in women with CBC (15.3%) than in women with UBC (5.2%), whereas combined, VUS were observed in similar frequencies in women with CBC and UBC. A protein alignment algorithm defined 16 rare VUS, occurring at highly conserved residues and/or conferring a considerable biochemical difference, the majority located in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain. We confirm a multiplicity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS that occur at a wide range of allele frequencies. Although some VUS inflict chemical differences at conserved residues, suggesting a deleterious effect, the majority are not associated with an increased risk of CBC.
  Using data from the Umbrian Population Cancer Registry (RTUP) we tested the hypothesis of relationships between several subsequent cancer sites in women who had had breast cancer. New patients (7,840) were collected from the RTUP between 01/01/1994 and 31/12/2006; 24 DCO cases were excluded; 332 successive multiple cancers in 320 patients were recorded. Including all second cancers, metachronous contralateral breast cancer, the observed/expected ratio (SIR) was non-significant. Excluding these cases, SIR was significantly lower whether with or without second skin carcinomas. SIR of all second metachronous contralateral cancers, excluding skin carcinomas, was non-significant. Significantly lower risk involved the colorectum, stomach, pancreas and metachronous breast with different histology. A significant excess was found of melanoma and total second breast cancers, including the contralateral. The excessive skin melanoma in breast cancer survivors was attributed to the relationship with BRCA2 and CDKN2A mutation-positive patients. The excess risk due to the CDKN2A mutation should also include pancreatic cancer which, in the present study, presented a significantly lower risk.
  OBJECTIVE: Prevention of ovarian cancer starts with identifying women at high risk for this deadly disease. Once identified, these women can be offered risk-reducing options such as oral contraceptives and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In this review, strategies for identifying high-risk individuals and the clinical utility of genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 will be discussed. CONCLUSION: To offer potentially life-saving interventions for at-risk family members, we propose that every woman newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer be offered genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes because mutations in these genes are the strongest known predictors of ovarian cancer risk.
  Identifying a BRCA mutation among families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer enables distinguishing those who may benefit from a specific medical management. This study aimed to evaluate the uptake of predictive testing among close relatives of a proband in Spanish families with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and to determine the associated demographic and clinical predictors. A retrospective cohort of families undergoing clinical genetic testing at four university hospitals in northeastern Spain was considered. From 108 unrelated BRCA1/2 families, 765 close relatives of probands were analyzed. Sixty percent of the first-degree and 28% of the second-degree relatives underwent predictive testing within a median time of 2 and 6 months, respectively, since the mutation disclosure to the proband. Relatives undergoing genetic testing were more likely to be female, first-degree, and belong to a family with a proband who had a high educational level. Relatives were also more likely to have offspring, a previous cancer diagnosis, and to be aged between 30 and 64 years. Among second-degree relatives, having a first-degree relative with cancer was highly correlated with uptake. In conclusion, uptake of BRCA1/2 predictive testing among close relatives was notably high and within a short period of time after disclosure of the mutation to the proband. Being female, a high educational level of the proband, and having a close relative with cancer were associated with uptake among relatives. Further studies are warranted to determine whether information is disseminated properly by probands and to learn about the reasons for those not undergoing testing.
  BACKGROUND/AIMS: BRCA mutation carriers have a high lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian malignancies. As genetic testing becomes widely available, preventative measures are a choice. We evaluated the characteristics of BRCA mutation carriers who chose prophylactic surgery (PS) compared to those who opted for surveillance. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes was performed. RESULTS: Ninety women were included, of whom 46 (51%) underwent PS. They were more likely to be a BRCA2 mutation carrier, parous, married, employed, and had a prior history of breast cancer. PS included 39 bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies and 13 mastectomies. Pathology was typically benign; however, 15% showed ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, 8% reported infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast, 3% was adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube, and 3% was adenocarcinoma of the ovary. CONCLUSION: It is notable that BRCA1 mutation carriers were less inclined to elect for PS. Evaluating the reasons for pursuing PS among women with a BRCA mutation is necessary and will require a larger data set. Long-term follow-up is required to describe the potential side effects of PS on quality of life.

  Fifteen years ago BRCA1 and BRCA2 were reported as high penetrant breast cancer predisposing genes. However, mutations in these genes are found in only a fraction of high risk families. BARD1 is a candidate breast cancer gene, but only a limited number of missense mutations with rather unclear pathogenic consequences have been reported.We screened 196 high risk breast cancer families for the occurrence of BARD1 variants. All genetic variants were analyzed using clinical information as well as IN SILICO predictive tools, including protein modeling. We found three candidate pathogenic mutations in seven families including a first case of a protein truncating mutation (p.Glu652fs) removing the entire second BRCT domain of BARD1. In conclusion, we provide evidence for an increased breast cancer risk associated to specific BARD1 germline mutations. However, these BARD1 mutations occur in a minority of hereditary breast cancer families.
  Fanconi anemia (FA) patients are specifically defective in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs), a complex process involving at least 13 FA proteins and other repair/checkpoint proteins. Of the 13 FA proteins, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, and FANCJ were previously found to be functionally conserved in C. elegans. We have also identified C. elegans homologs of FANCM and FANCI, and determined their epistatic relationships with homologs of FANCD2, checkpoint proteins, and RAD51 upon DNA crosslinking. The counterparts of FANCM, FANCI, and three checkpoint proteins (RPA, ATR and CHK1) are required for focus formation and ubiquitination associated with FANCD2 in C. elegans. However, C. elegans FANCM affects neither RPA focus formation nor CHK1 phosphorylation induced by ICLs, unlike the reported role of human FANCM, which influences ATR-CHK1 signaling at stalled replication forks. Although focus formation by both FANCD2 and RAD51 requires ATR-CHK1 signaling, FANCD2 and RAD51 acted independently in the formation of their respective foci. Thus, the FANCD2 activation pathway involving FANCM, FANCI, and the checkpoint proteins is conserved in C. elegans but with distinct differences.
  The transcription factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a key regulator of cell proliferation and is overexpressed in many forms of primary cancers, leading to uncontrolled cell division and genomic instability. To address the role of FOXM1 in chemoresistance, we generated a cisplatin-resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7-CIS(R)), which had an elevated level of FOXM1 protein and mRNA expression relative to the parental MCF-7 cells. A close correlation was observed between FOXM1 and the expression of its proposed downstream targets that are involved in DNA repair; breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BRCA2) and X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) were expressed at higher levels in the resistant cell lines compared with the sensitive MCF-7 cells. Moreover, cisplatin treatment induced DNA damage repair in MCF-7-CIS(R) and not in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the expression of a constitutively active FOXM1 (DeltaN-FOXM1) in MCF-7 cells alone was sufficient to confer cisplatin resistance. Crucially, the impairment of DNA damage repair pathways through the small interfering RNA knockdown inhibition of either FOXM1 or BRCA2/XRCC1 showed that only the silencing of FOXM1 could significantly reduce the rate of proliferation in response to cisplatin treatment in the resistant cells. This suggests that the targeting of FOXM1 is a viable strategy in circumventing acquired cisplatin resistance. Consistently, the FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton also showed efficacy in causing cell death and proliferative arrest in the cisplatin-resistant cells through the downregulation of FOXM1 expression. Taken together, we have identified a novel mechanism of acquired cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells through the induction of FOXM1.
